            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Deſign of this enſuing Diſcourſe, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and convert from the evil of their ways, thoſe men that have taken upon them the work and office of <hi>Informers;</hi> and alſo to keep others from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partakers of their ſins. By <hi>Informers,</hi> I mean ſuch perſons as under a pretence of ſuppreſſing ſeditious <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,</hi> do create much diſturbance to men fearing God, cauſing their Aſſemblies to be broken up, and the perſons whom they find aſſembled together to be fined; although they can prove no crime againſt them, but that they find them praying to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and preaching and hearing Gods holy word. Which practice of theirs ſeems to me, to be exceeding ſinful, and greatly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to their own and others eternal Salvation, of which I have given ſeveral demonſtrations, and have anſwered their moſt material Plea's that did come to my thoughts, whereby they ſeek to excuſe and extenuate their ſin.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, theſe <hi>Informers</hi> are ſo hardened in their ſinful ways, that there's no hope that they ſhould be brought to repentance, and therefore you might have ſpared your labour in endeavouring to reclaim them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> There is hope that the worſt of men may be brought to repentance, even ſuch as are ſlaves to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and are taken and led captive by him at his will; and therefore ſuch as are grown to that height of ſin, as to oppoſe the truth, are to be inſtructed with meekneſs, as not knowing but God may give them repentance unto life. <hi>2 Tim. 2.25, 26. In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth. And that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of
<pb facs="tcp:102521:3"/>the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> God can do great things by weak and unlikely means, to ſtill and quiet thoſe that are enemies to, and afflicters of his people. <hi>Pſal. 8.2. Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine enemies, that thou mighteſt ſtill the enemy and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger. Ultores vocat illos, qui laedunt eos qui fidunt Deo.</hi> Vatabl.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> If any one of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> that are ſprung up in any part of this Nation, ſhould be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though the reſt ſhould periſh in their evil courſes; I ſhould think my pains well beſtowed, for the converſion of one ſinner from the error of his ways. For one ſoul is of more worth than the whole world, <hi>Mark 8.36.</hi> And one ſinner deſtroyeth much good, <hi>Eccleſ. 9.18.</hi> Not only ſeveral perſons, but Towns, yea Countries may enjoy peace by the converſion of one <hi>Informer.</hi> For ſome of them are ſuch turbulent perſons, that they do not only diſquiet their neighbours that live in the ſame Towns with themſelves, but they go from one Town to another, and from one County to another, raiſing perſecution againſt thoſe that meet together in a peaceable manner, to pray to God in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and to preach and hear his holy word. When <hi>Saul,</hi> who was a great perſecutor of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, was converted; ſeveral Churches had reſt and peace thereby. <hi>Act. 9.31. Then had the Churches reſt through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and comfort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplied.</hi> What great benefits accrued to ſeveral Churches by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion but of one perſecutor, who had been an active man in perſecuting the members of Chriſt? The reſt, the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the multiplying, the ſpiritual comfort of the Churches in <hi>Judea, Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> followed upon the converſion of <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102521:3"/>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> If none that are actually engaged in this way of being <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould be reclaimed, yet by opening the horrible and dangerous nature of their ſin, others that are or may be hereafter under a temptation to turn <hi>Informers,</hi> being tempted thereto by poverty, enticing of evil minded men, promiſe of a reward, affrighted by threatnings, or any other way; may be prevented from following their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ways. They are more fooliſh than the birds, that will be allured to take the bait, when they eſpy the net. <hi>Prov. 1.17. Surely in vain is the net ſpread in the ſight of any bird.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> If none ſhould receive any benefit by what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet by warning thoſe that are engaged in this ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to turn from their evil ways, and warning others not to be partakers of their evil deeds; I ſhall deliver my own ſoul. <hi>Ezek. 3.19. If thou warn the wicked man, and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way; he ſhall dye in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, Theſe papers are not like to come into the <hi>Informers</hi> hands; or if they ſhould, they will not beſtow the pains to read them; or if they ſhould, they will but make a ſcoff at them; or they will be but the more enraged; and therefore it is to no effect that this means ſhould be uſed to reclaim them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1.</hi> We muſt do our duty, and leave the ſucceſs to God. <hi>Eccl. 11.6. In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, this, or the other; or both be alike good.</hi> I leave it wholly to the providence of God, what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he will give to my endeavours. It may be he will put it into the hearts of ſome perſons that compaſſionate the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> to ſend theſe papers to them; and it may be he will move their hearts to read them, and who can tell but he may touch their hearts in reading them, and cauſe ſome of the arrows drawn out of his quiver to ſtick ſo faſt in their conſciences, as they ſhall not be able to ſhake them of.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Writing as well as preaching is a means to bring ſinners to repentance. <hi>Jer. 36.2. Take thee the roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have ſpoken unto thee, againſt Iſrael and againſt Judah, and againſt all the nations. It may be that the houſe of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive them their iniquity and their ſin.</hi> I obſerve here;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. Jeremiah</hi> had no aſſurance that the <hi>Jews</hi> would read or hear what he wrote; there was only a probability of it, <hi>It may be the houſe of Judah will hear.</hi> Yet he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write in a book the judgments of God that hung over their heads for their ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2.</hi> When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was hindered from preaching, as he formerly had done; <hi>ver. 5. I am ſhut up, I cannot go into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> God preſcribed this way as the moſt likely means to bring them to repentance, for <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to write unto the <hi>Jews, Write all theſe words, that I have ſpoken to thee againſt Judah. It may be the houſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3.</hi> Though theſe <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould not hearken to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that I have given them; yet whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, it is the mind and will of God, that ſinners ſhould be called to repentance. <hi>Ezek. 2.7. And thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are moſt rebellious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4.</hi> Scorning is a great ſin, and bringeth down mighty judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Prov. 19 29. Judgments are prepared for ſcorners,</hi> Jer. <hi>22.28. Now therefore be ye not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong.</hi> Yet though theſe <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould prove ſcorners, we muſt not conclude their caſe deſperate, but uſe means to bring them to repentance; both reproving them for their ſin, and letting them ſee there is mercy for them, if they will turn when they are reproved for their ſins.
<pb facs="tcp:102521:4"/>
               <hi>Prov. 1.22, 23. How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; and the ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledg! Turn at my reproof; behold I will pour out my ſpirit upon you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi> But if they will perſiſt in their ſins, and ſcorn thoſe means that are uſed to bring them to repentance, their ſcorning will not hurt me, but themſelves. <hi>Prov. 9.12. If thou ſcorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it.</hi> And let ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſider what is ſaid, <hi>Prov. 3.34. Surely he ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſcorners.</hi> And <hi>Prov. 1.24.</hi> to the <hi>32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5.</hi> If none of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould vouchſafe to read what I have written for the convincing them of their ſin; yet it may fall into the hands of their friends and relations, and they may hereby be put upon mourning and praying for them, and endeavouring their converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6.</hi> As for their being enraged at what I have written; I ſhall reply, <hi>1.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus ſpake nothing but the truth; yet many of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo incenſed againſt him, that they would have thrown him down headlong from an high hill. <hi>Luk. 4.28, 29. And all they in the ſynagogue, when they heard theſe things, were filled with wrath, and roſe up and thruſt him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the hill, whereon their City was built, that they might caſt him down headlong.</hi> Yet he did not forbear reproving them for their ſins; though he was hated by the world on this very account, for teſtifying that the deeds thereof were evil. <hi>Joh. 7.7. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I teſtifie of it, that the deeds thereof are evil.</hi> Yea, though their hatred aroſe to ſuch an height, as that they wont about to kill him, yet he taught them and reproved them for their ſins. <hi>v. 14, 19. Now about the midſt of the feaſt, Jeſus went into the Temple, and taught, none of you keepeth the law, why go ye about to kill me?</hi> Joh. <hi>8.40. And now ye ſeek to kill me, a man which hath told you the truth. 2.</hi> If God ſhall touch any one of their hearts, and reclaim them
<pb facs="tcp:102521:5"/>from their evil ways, inſtead of being enraged, they will bleſs God, and be thankful to them whom God makes inſtruments of keeping them from ſin. When <hi>David</hi> was kept by <hi>Abigails</hi> advice from ſhedding of blood, he was thankful to God for putting it into <hi>Abigails</hi> heart to come to him, and thankful to her for her good counſel. <hi>1 Sam. 25.32, 33. And David ſaid to Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee this day to meet me; and bleſſed be thy advice; and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging my ſelf with mine own hand. Nabal</hi> was a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> who had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>David</hi> evil for good. To be kept from perſecuting the ſervants of God, is as great a favour as to be kept from avenging a mans ſelf on a ſon of <hi>Belial:</hi> And if <hi>David</hi> was ſo thankful to God the author, and <hi>Abigail</hi> the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his preſervation from ſin; why ſhould not theſe men, in ſtead of railing and fretting, ſay in their hearts, Bleſſed be the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſent this man to ſhew us our ſin, and bleſſed be he, and bleſſed be his advice?</p>
            <p>To prevent miſtakes, and the uncharitable cenſures that ſome may be ready to paſs upon this enſuing diſcourſe, I do freely and ſincerely declare, that I have no deſign to take off any Magiſtrate, Officer, or any other perſons, from uſing all due care and diligence to prevent tumults and Inſurrections; but only to lay open the greatneſs, and prevent the growth of their ſin, who under a pretence of preventing ſeditious Meetings, do ſuppreſs religious Exerciſes. The diſcovery of the folly of theſe men and their practiſes, being a likely means to put a ſtop to their ſinful proceedings, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the truth. <hi>2 Tim. 3.9. But they ſhall proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THere are certain men riſen up in this Nation, called <hi>INFORMERS,</hi> whoſe trangreſſion ſaith within my heart, that they are wandred out of the path of life, and are going on apace in the broad way that leads to deſtruction. I have not only heard of them, but I have met with ſome of them in the very act of their ſin. When I had conſidered their ways, I thought my ſelf obliged to endeavour the turning them from their ſinful courſes. For I find in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a ſtrict charge given to him that meeteth his Neighbours Ox or Aſſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray, to bring it back, though his Neighbour be his enemy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4. <hi>If thou meeteſt thine enemies Oxe or his Aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again.</hi> It is a greater act of Charity to bring back a ſinner that is gone aſtray from God, than to bring back an Oxe or an Aſſe of our enemies, that was gone aſtray from him. And we are under ſtronger obligations to endeavour the converſion of a ſinner, than to bring back the ſtraying Oxe or Aſſe of an enemy, on ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. For,</p>
               <p>1. The Soul of a man is of more worth than all the Oxen and Aſſes upon the face of the earth; yea the Soul of the meaneſt man is of greater value than the whole world, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36. <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is far more dangerous for a ſinner to go aſtray from God, than an Oxe or an Aſſe to go aſtray from his owner. For the Oxe that goeth from one Maſter, may find another that may take care of it; or the Oxe may get a ſubſiſtence by ranging abroad, as well as abiding at home; or if the ſtraying Oxe ſhould be ſlain, its miſery endeth with its life: But the ſinner that goeth aſtray from God, unleſs he be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will fall into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, and will periſh eternally.</p>
               <p>3. God hath a greater right to the Souls of men, than any man hath to his Oxen or Aſſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>All ſouls are mine.</hi> They are the work of his hands, and therefore he may claim a greater propriety in them, than any man can in thoſe things which he hath bought with his money, or calls his own on the account of any other title.</p>
               <p>4. We are more obliged to bring unto God (who is our Soveraign Lord, our heavenly Father, our deareſt Friend) that which is his own, when gone aſtray from him, than we are to bring back to our enemy his Oxe or his Aſſe when we meet it going aſtray. If then he that meeteth his enemies Oxe or Aſſe going aſtray, be under a ſtrict charge to bring it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102521:6"/>back, <hi>Thou ſhait ſurely bring it back to him again;</hi> how much more are we obliged to endeavour the converſion of a ſinner, when we meet him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray from God, though he be one of the greateſt enemies we have in the-world?</p>
               <p>When I had conſidered not only the ſwift deſtruction theſe <hi>Informers</hi> bring upon their own Souls, but alſo what miſchief they have already done, and may further do unto men fearing God, if not reclaimed; how many they draw to be partakers with them in their ſin; what temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons needy and malicious men may be under to follow their pernicious ways; what great guilt is brought upon the Nation by their means; I thought with my ſelf, that the leading theſe men to repentance would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a publick good, as well as be an act of kindneſs to their own Souls, and ſo was the more confirmed in my reſolution to endeavour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them from the error of their ways.</p>
               <p>The moſt effectual way to reclaim theſe men from their evil ways ſeems to me to be this; To demonſtrate out of the word of God the greatneſs and the dangerous nature of this ſin, which I conceive they either know not, or at leaſt do not conſider it. For that is the moſt powerful means that can be uſed for converting a ſinner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi> If the word of God will not prevail with them to turn from their evil ways, though one ſhould ariſe from the dead, either one of the Saints, that hath been in heaven, and ſhould tell them what a glorious Kingdom they ſhall loſe, if they perſiſt in their ſins; or one of their fellow ſinners ſhould come out of hell, and tell them what torments they have felt in that Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, and they will certainly come into that place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they go on in their evil ways; yet this would not perſwade them to repent. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29, 30, 31. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them. And he ſaid, nay father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my more orderly proceeding with theſe men, I ſhall uſe this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:
<list>
                     <item>1. I ſhall ſhew what <hi>Informers</hi> I mean and aim at in this Diſcourſe.</item>
                     <item>2. I ſhall premiſe ſomething concerning the perſons whom they moleſt, and the work for which they moleſt them.</item>
                     <item>3. I ſhall by ſeveral arguments endeavour to convince them of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin.</item>
                     <item>4. I ſhall anſwer their Plea's, whereby they excuſe their ſin.</item>
                     <item>5. I ſhall draw ſome Inferences for their and others inſtruction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Informers</hi> I deſign in this Diſcourſe to convince of the evil of their ways, are ſuch as either for the love of money, or out of malice, or a blind zeal, or any other evil principle, under a pretence of ſuppreſſing ſeditious Conventicles, go to the Aſſemblies where thoſe Miniſters (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Nonconformists</hi>) do pray to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and do read the holy Scriptures, and preach the Goſpel; and if they find them either Praying or Preaching, they procure Officers to break up their Aſſemblies, or elſe they go to the Magiſtrates, and by the Information
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102521:6"/>they give againſt thoſe preſent at the foreſaid Aſſemblies, they ſtir them up either to impriſon the Miniſter, or to fine him, or ſuch of the people as they think good, in great ſums of money.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I deal with theſe <hi>Informers</hi> only that come to, and raiſe up trouble againſt theſe Aſſemblies, where thoſe Miniſters called <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,</hi> pray to God, and inſtruct the people, are theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. I have obſerved, that their chief deſign and endeavour hath been to moleſt thoſe Meetings.</item>
                     <item>2. I have no knowledg what is ſaid or done at other Meetings, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to my remembrance having been preſent at any of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not juſtifie nor condemn them; but ſhall leave that to thoſe that are concerned therein.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In order to the conviction of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> of the evil of their ways, I ſhall premiſe three Propoſitions:
<list>
                     <item>1. Thoſe Miniſters whom they perſecute, are righteous men, and there are many righteous perſons that frequent their Aſſemblies.</item>
                     <item>2. Praying and preaching, which are the works for which they are perſecuted, are good works.</item>
                     <item>3. Theſe Miniſters that are perſecuted by theſe <hi>Informers</hi> for praying and preaching, are true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and are called of God to preach the Goſpel. I ſhall briefly prove theſe three Propoſitions.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Miniſters whom theſe <hi>Informers</hi> perſecute, are righteous men; to evidence this, conſider:</p>
               <p>1. They are ſound in the Faith, they believe all things that are written by the Prophets and Apoſtles. They imbrace that Faith which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the Proteſtant Churches; and particularly, they own the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> although they have different apprehenſions about the Diſcipline. Soundneſs in the Faith is requiſite to make a man a righteous man (although that alone be not ſufficient); for Hereſie is a work of the fleſh, which will ſhut a man out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, as well as Idolatry, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, or ſuch like ſins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>2. They are righteous men in Gods account, who walk in all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and all his Commandments in a blameleſs manner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> That evidence which is given of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Zacbarias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> may be given of theſe men, they walk in all the Ordinances of God, they have reſpect to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and are blameleſs in their converſations. They are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and baptize others in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; they often celebrate the Lords Supper; they praiſe God in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms; they keep holy the Sabbath day; they pray to God in ſecret, and pray in their Families, they worſhip God in publick Aſſemblies, as well as privately; they are juſt, ſober, temperate, patient under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They viſit the fatherleſs and the widows in their affliction, and they keep themſelves unſpotted of the world, and they that do ſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound in the Faith) are Religious men, and their Religion is pure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102521:7"/>and undefiled in the ſight of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To viſit the fatherleſs and widow in their affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi> They endeavour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities and their opportunities, to do good unto all men; And that is an argument, that they are born of God, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 11. <hi>He that doth good is of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. They train up their children and ſervants in the knowledg and the fear of the Lord, and that is an evidence of a righteous man; when he doth not only ſerve God, and walk with God himſelf, but teacheth his houſhold to do ſo alſo, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord. Cornelius</hi> his piety was evidenced by training up his houſe in the fear of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2. <hi>A devout man, and one that feared God with all his houſe.</hi> God takes ſpecial notice of <hi>Abrahams</hi> piety, in that he was careful that his children and his whole houſe ſhould keep the ways of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, Some think and ſpeak otherwiſe of theſe Miniſters which are called <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> as if they were deceivers of the people, and were not good men.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: 1. So did many among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> there were differing thoughts concerning Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Some ſaid he is a good man; others ſaid, nay, but he deceiveth the people.</hi> There were as evil reports raiſed, and as diſhonourable ſpeeches given out againſt the Apoſtles, as there are againſt theſe men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8. <hi>By honour and diſhonour, by evil and good report, as deceivers and yet true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God foreſaw that ſcandalous reports would be raiſed againſt righteous men; and that they would be miſrepreſented in the world, whereby many would be deceived, and be ready to condemn the innocent; and therefore he hath given us a ſure rule to judg who is a righteous man; He that doth righteouſneſs, he is a righteous man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, even as he is righteous.</hi> Theſe men approve themſelves to be righteous men by their conſtant care to do thoſe things which are juſt and right in the ſight of God and men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their adverſaries that reproach them, would be glad to be in their condition when they dye; then they will wiſh, that their laſt end may be like theirs.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, Do you know all thoſe Miniſters which are called <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> that you know them to be righteous men?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; 1. With ſome of them I have had intimate acquaintance for ſeveral years, and have fully known their Doctrine and manner of life, and I am abundantly ſatisfied in what I have aſſerted, that they are men of ſound judgments, of upright, holy, and exemplary converſations. And Charity obligeth me to believe and hope the like of the reſt, although I have no perſonal acquaintance with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any Miniſter that goeth under the name of a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> be not a righteous man; I plead not his cauſe, but diſlike and diſown ſuch a man as much as the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> do.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102521:7"/>
               <p>And as theſe Miniſters are righteous men, ſo there are many of thoſe that come to their Aſſemblies; I ſay not that they are all righteous that come to their Meetings (for the Goſpel is like a Net, which draweth good and bad); but this I ſay, there are many righteous perſons come to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, ſuch as are of an holy blameleſs converſation, well reported of for good works, who have no other deſign in frequenting theſe Meetings, than the glorifying God and the ſaving their own ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Praying to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for things agreeable to his will, and Preaching and Hearing of Gods Word, are good works. Prayer is a good work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prayer, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for Kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It is commanded of God, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>I will therefore, that men pray every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</hi> Theſe words may relate to verſe 3, where the Apoſtle had told us, that <hi>praying for all men is good and acceptable in the ſight of God.</hi> And therefore commands that men pray every-where.</p>
               <p>2. Prayer, when made by upright men, is delightful to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God promiſeth great bleſſings to them that pray to him, as eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Whoſoever calleth upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The giving of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Your heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Yea all good things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as Praying, ſo Preaching of the Goſpel is a good work: For,</p>
               <p>1. It is commanded by God, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the world, preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It doth great good to the ſouls of men. It turns them from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan to God. It is the great inſtrument of ſaving mens ſouls, even that preaching which the world counteth fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>It pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God promiſeth to reward this work with a Crown of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 4. <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort; Feed the flock of God, which is among you. And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of glory, which fadeth not away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Preaching, ſo Hearing the Word is a good work: For,</p>
               <p>1. It is commanded of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Let every one be ſwiſt to bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It hath the promiſe of life and ſalvation annexed to it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Hear and your ſoul ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By Hearing the Word of God we get great good for our ſouls. For hereby we get faving faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing.</hi> And have the Holy Ghoſt communicated to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44. <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on them that heard him;</hi> with many other precious bleſſings. And yet for theſe things are Miniſters that preach and pray, and people that hear them, vexed and moleſted.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102521:8"/>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Miniſters are true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; called of God to preach the Goſpel. To prove this, confider:</p>
               <p>1. They have the internal call, which conſiſts in beſtowing Miniſterial abilities, and a willingneſs to ſerve the Lord in the work of the Miniſtry. Gods diſtribution of abilities is one branch of this call, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>As God hath diſtributed, as God hath called every man.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus proves his Call to the Miniſtry, by being anointed with the Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor.</hi> Theſe Miniſters are endued with Miniſterial abilities, and have thoſe qualifications required by the Apoſtle in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. They are blameleſs, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, given to hoſpitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no ſtrikers, they rule their houſes well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The internal Call conſiſts alſo in a willingneſs and deſire, ſtirred up in the heart by the Spirit of God, to undertake this work and office of preaching the Goſpel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.5, 6, 7. In the <hi>5th</hi> verſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, that of all the Tribes, God had choſen <hi>Levi</hi> to miniſter to him; and v. 7. he tells us which of the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> were to be admitted to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter before the Lord, namely, <hi>he that came with all the deſire of his mind.</hi> This willing mind to ſerve the Lord in the work of the Miniſtry, God hath given unto theſe men.</p>
               <p>2. They have given up themſelves unto the Lord, to ſerve him in the Goſpel of his Son; and have been ſet apart for this work in a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by faſting and prayer, and moſt of them alſo with impoſition of hands. And they that having the internal Call, are ſeparated and ſet apart by faſting and prayer for the work of the Miniſtry, are ſent out by God to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2, 3, 4. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had faſted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away. So they being ſent forth by the Holy Ghoſt, departed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They prove themſelves to be true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of truth. There is nothing contrary to ſound Doctrine in what they teach and preach unto the people. This was the way by which the Apoſtle proved himſelf a true Miniſter, by preaching the word of truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.7. <hi>But in all things approving your ſelves as the Miniſters of God, by the word of truth.</hi> And thus <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> proved Chriſt to be ſent of God, becauſe he preached Gods word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God.</hi> Such as being ſeparated to the work of the Miniſtry, do teach the truth, and preach ſound Doctrine, are good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. <hi>If thou put the Brethren in remembrance of theſe things, thou ſhalt be a good Miniſter of Jeſus Christ, nouriſhed up in the words of faith and good doctrine, whereunto thou haſt attained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. God hath given evidence to the truth of their Call to the Miniſtry by the converſion of many ſouls. They have been inſtrumental to turn many ſouls from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God; and alſo to edifie and build up ſuch as are converted. When there were ſome that queſtioned, whether <hi>Paul</hi> were a true Apoſtle; he proves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a true Apoſtle, by the ſucceſs God had given his Miniſtry in the converſion of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle? Are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102521:8"/>not you my work in the Lord? If I am not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſs am unto you, for the ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The people that do feel the want of the word, and deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the way to life and ſalvation, do call upon them to preach the word to them. We read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he concluded aſſuredly that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to preach the Goſpel in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> becauſe he ſaw a man in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion calling to him, <hi>Come over into Macedonia and help us, Act.</hi> 16.9, 10. There are multitudes of people that call out to theſe men, Come and help us. Why may they not thence aſſuredly gather, that the Lord hath called them to preach to them, being ſuch as are duly qualified, and have been ſet apart for the work of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Theſe men were not ordained to the work of the Miniſtry by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and therefore are no true Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Miniſters of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſeveral other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, have no other Ordination than by <hi>Presbyters;</hi> yet are their Churches owned by moſt Proteſtants for true Churches, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> were ordained by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> yet theſe <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> proſecute them with as great fury as they do others, making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe whoſe cauſe I plead, that were not ordained by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> were ſet apart to the work of the Miniſtry with faſting and prayer by the <hi>Elders</hi> of other Churches. And it is contrary to the judgment of many learned Biſhops, and great Aſſertors of Epiſcopacy, to deny thoſe to be true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that were ordained by Presbyters, becauſe they had not Epiſcopal Ordination. For divers inſtances might be given out of their Writings, whereby it appeareth they did allow Ordination by Presbyters to be valid and lawful; eſpecially in ſuch caſes as Ordination could not be had by Biſhops, and <hi>in Eccleſiâ turbatâ;</hi> which is the caſe of ſeveral of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they were ſet apart to the work of the Miniſtry when Biſhops were laid aſide in the Nation, and when the Nation and Church were in great troubles. I will mention two or three. Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Scotland, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 514. makes mention of three Biſhops that came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be Conſecrated in <hi>England;</hi> 
                  <q>when the time and place for the Conſecration was agreed on, a Queſtion in the mean time was moved by Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> touching the Conſecration of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Biſhops, who as he ſaid muſt firſt be ordained Presbyters, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received no Ordination from a Biſhop. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who was by, maintained that thereof there was no neceſſity, ſeeing where Biſhops could not be had, the Ordination given by the Presbyters muſt be eſteemed lawful: Otherwiſe that it might be doubted, if there were any lawful vocation in moſt of the Reformed Churches. This applauded too by the other Biſhops, <hi>Ely</hi> acquieſced, and at the day, and in the place appointed, the three <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Biſhops were Confecrated.</q> Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> who was Profeſſor of Divinity in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterward a Biſhop, hath this paſſage in his Diſputations, <hi>De Diſciplinâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae; Presbyterum Presbyteros ordinare poſſe, preſertim deficientibus Epiſcopis concedit cum Sententiarum Magiſtro ſanior Pars Scholaſticorum.</hi> That a Presbyter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102521:9"/>may Ordain Presbyters, eſpecially where there are no Biſhops, is granted by the Maſter of Sentences, and the ſounder part of the Schoolmen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Miniſters were ſet apart to the work of the Miniſtry by the Elders of other Churches; and in Scripture a Biſhop and an Elder are all one; ſo that they were Ordained by ſuch as the Scripture calleth <hi>Biſhops,</hi> though not by <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> The clearing of this, that Biſhops and Elders were all one in Scripture account, will I conceive give a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Objection. To this purpoſe let theſe Scriptures be well-weigh'd; <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17, 28. <hi>And from Miletus he ſent and called the Elders of the Church of Epheſus.</hi> And ſpeaking to theſe Elders he ſaith, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers.</hi> The ſame perſons whom he calls <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the <hi>28th</hi> verſe; whence it may be inferred, that Elders and Biſhops are the ſame in Scripture-ſenſe. So alſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. l. <hi>Paul and Timotheus the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, to all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus which are at Philippi, with Biſhops and Deacons. Pareus</hi> obſerves in his Commentary on this place, That in the Apoſtles times, all the Miniſters of the Goſpel were called Biſhops; becauſe the Apoſtle mentions ſeveral Biſhops as well as Deacons in one Church; and concludes, that though after-ages made a diſtinction, yet by Divine right and Apoſtolical practice a Biſhop and Presbyter were all one. His words are theſe, <hi>Apparet hinc tempore Apoſtolorum nomen Epiſcopi fuiſſe omnibus Evangelii doctoribus commune; quia plures uni Eccleſiae Epiſcopos, uti &amp; Diaconos tribuit Apoſtolus, Epiſcopos igitur &amp; Presbyter jure Divino &amp; Apoſtolica conſuetudine idem eſt.</hi> Tit. 1.5, 7. <hi>For this cauſe leſt I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I appointed thee;</hi> and then ver. 6. he gives qualifications of an Elder, and then adds, ver. 7. <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs.</hi> Whom he calls an Elder in ver. 5. he calls a Biſhop ver. 7. And if a Biſhop and an Elder were not all one, what coherence would there be in the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, to tell him he left him to ordain Elders in every City, and what manner of perſons they muſt be; and then to add, <hi>for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs.</hi> And that this is no novel interpretation, I may produce ſeveral Authors. As judicious <hi>Calvin, Locus hic abunde docet; nullum eſſe Presbyteri &amp; Epiſcopi diſcrimen.</hi> Johan. Piſcator. Schol. v. 7. <hi>En hic nominat Epiſcopum, quem</hi> v. 5. <hi>nominaverat Presbyterum. Hierome</hi> alſo, who was born about the year 342, and dyed about the year 420, gives in full and clear evidence to this, that in the time of the Apoſtles a Biſhop and a Presbyter were all one. And <hi>Blondel</hi> hath written a large and learned Treatiſe to defend <hi>Hierome</hi>'s aſſertion, <hi>De primitiva Epiſcopi &amp; Presbyteri</hi>

               <p>THeſe things being premiſed, I ſhall now by ſeveral Arguments demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the greatneſs and horrible nature of their Sin, who go to the Aſſemblies where theſe Miniſters of Chriſt, called by the name of <hi>Non-conſormiſts,</hi> do pray to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and preach the Goſpel to them that are met together, and if they find them either praying or preaching, they procure Officers to interupt them, while they are worſhipping God, and cauſe their Aſſemblies to be broken; or elſe go and make Oath againſt them, and cauſe them to be fined in great ſums of Money, and get out Warrants to Diſtrain and take away their Goods from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Informers are guilty of perſecuting righteous men for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, and to perſecute righteous men for righteouſneſs ſake, is an horrible Sin; which will appear evidently from ſeveral Scripture. I will inſtance in three or four, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.34, 35. <hi>Behold, I ſend unto you Prophets, and Wiſemen and Scribes, and ſome of them ye ſhall kill, and crucifie, and ſome of them ye ſhall ſcourge in your Synagogues, and perſecute them from City to City, that upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous</hi> Abel, <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zacharias, <hi>whom ye ſlew between the Porch and the Altar.</hi> Obſerve here, Perſecution involves a man in the guilt of righteous blood, in the guilt of all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed upon the earth ſince the world ſtood, which, if it were well conſidered and believed, and laid to heart, were enough to fill the heart of theſe men with unſpeakable horror. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Let their Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102521:10"/>a feare before them, and that which ſhould have been for their welfare become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened, that they ſee not, and make their loins continually to ſhake. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation be deſolate, and let none dwell in their tents. For they perſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and they talk to the grief of him, whom thou haſt wounded. Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteouſneſs. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</hi> Obſerve here,</p>
               <p>1. A Catalogue of dreadful curſes, ſuch as may make a mans ears tingle to hear of them.</p>
               <p>2. The Perſons againſt whom, and the cauſe for which they are denounced, and they are ſuch as perſecute the people of God, for this very Sin of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>For they perſecute him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. The perſon that imprecates, or (as ſome) by a Spirit of Propheſie foretells what ſhould befall Perſecutors, and that was <hi>David,</hi> who in this Pſalm, repreſents and perſonates our Lord Jeſus: And ſo we may look upon it, as our Lord Jeſus curſing, and foretelling what curſes ſhould come upon thoſe that ſhould perſecute him and his members. Now let us conſider what theſe curſes are, which <hi>David,</hi> or rather our Lord Jeſus foretells, ſhould come upon Perſecutors. Their bleſſings ſhall be curſed, <hi>their table ſhall be their ſnare, and that which ſhould have been their welfare become a trap,</hi> v. 22. Their eyes ſhall be darkned, that is, they ſhall be ſmitten with ſpiritual blindneſs, and their loins ſhall ſhake continually; that is, they ſhall be as unable for any good work, as a man whoſe loins ſhake continually; or elſe a guilty Conſcience ſhall make them ſhake for fear, even where no fear is, <hi>v.</hi> 28. God will pour out his indignation upon them; pouring out ſignifies the abundance of wrath, as when the clouds are ſaid to pour down rain, it implies abundance of rain; and his wrathful anger ſhall take hold of them, it ſhall not only fall upon them but abide, and take ſuch hold as they ſhall not get from it, <hi>v.</hi> 24. God will give them up to their hearts luſts, and puniſh this Sin by letting them go on in their Sins, by adding one Sin to another, which is a ſore judgment. And will not let them come into his righteouſneſs; that is, will let them dye in their Sins, will not let them partake of his mercy and favour, will not let them have any ſhare of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 26. They ſhall be cut off from the land of the living, and have no part with the righteous in the world to come, <hi>v.</hi> 27. God will viſit their families and poſterity with deſolating judgments, <hi>v,</hi> 25. This ſhall be the portion of them that perſecute the members of the Lord Jeſus, if they continue in this Sin without repentance. See another Scripture, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 7.13. <hi>He ordaineth his arrows againſt the perſecutors.</hi> And wo to thoſe men againſt whom the great God, the Lord of Hoſts, ordaineth his arrows. And whereas he ſaith not his Arrow, but he ordaineth his arrows againſt the Perſecutors, it implyeth that God hath ſeveral ſorts of judgments in ſtore for Perſecutors, both judgments in this life, and the life to come.</p>
               <p>It may be you will ſay, we ſee Perſecutors of righteous men are in a very dreadful condition, but we hope we are not guilty of this great Sin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution by our moleſting theſe men in their meetings, and cauſing their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102521:10"/>goods to be taken from them. Did we hale them to Priſons, or cauſe them to be put to death, then we might juſtly be called Perſecutors; but ſeeing we do not take away their lives, but their goods, we hope we are no Perſecutors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. All injuries done wittingly to righteous men, either in word or deed, eſpecially when they are troubled for righteouſneſs ſake, are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did not offer any violence to the life, perſon, or eſtate of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> He did but mock him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. yet he is charged with perſecuting <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Gal. 4.29. <hi>But as then he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit; even ſo it is non. Job</hi>'s friends did not afflict his body, nor touch his eſtate, nor diſturb him at his devotion; only they grieved his Spirit by their reproaches, and uncharitable cenſures of him, and they are charged with the guilt of perſecution. <hi>Job.</hi> 19.21, 22. <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, Oh ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me, why do ye perſecute me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of his Perſecutors, tells us one way whereby they perſecuted him, was by talking and ſpeaking thoſe things which cauſed him grief. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69 26, <hi>They perſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and talk to the grief of them, whom thou haſt wounded.</hi> If uncharitable cenſures, reproaches, ſcoffs, be a degree of perſecution; how can you waſh your hands from the guilt of this Sin, who call their meeting to worſhip God by reproachful terms, who diſturb them in their devotions; carry them before Magiſtrates, and cauſe their goods to be taken from them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though you do not take one drop of blood from theſe men, yet if you hate them, and what you do to them proceed out of hatred; then are you Murtherers in God's account, and ſhall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever hateth his Brother is a murtherer, and you know no murtherer hath eternal life abiding in him.</hi> As unchaſt luſts are adultery in God's account, and he that luſteth after a woman though he never touch her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. So malicious actions are Murther, and he that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though he offer no violence to his life, hath murthered him in his heart: I will not charge you with hatred, I leave that to God, and your own Conſciences; But this I will ſay, I cannot underſtand how your actings are conſiſtent with love: <hi>For love worketh no ill to his Neighbour,</hi> Rom. 13.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By taking away their livelyhood whereby their lives are preſerved, you are guilty before God of taking away their lives; For a mans livelyhood is in Scripture accounted his life; elſe what means that Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.6. <hi>No man ſhall take the nether or the upper-milſtone to pledge, for he taketh a mans life to pledge?</hi> Why is the taking the upper or nether milſtone to pledge, the taking a mans life to pledge; but becauſe it is the taking that which is the means of preſerving his life by procuring him a livelyhood?</p>
               <p n="4">4. By hindring them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtery, you take away that which is as dear to them as their lives, <hi>Act</hi> 20.24. <hi>But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear to my ſelf; ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtery which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You have cauſe to fear leſt a worſe Sin than blood be laid to your
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102521:11"/>charge. What's that? what is worſe than blood? The loſs and ruine of immortal Souls, who poſſibly might have obtained Salvation, had not you broken up the meetings where they went to attend, when now they may become a prey to erroneous perſons, and be ſwallowed up of Satan, who goeth about like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour. Scattered ſheep are in danger to be a prey to wild beaſts: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4, 5. <hi>With force and with cruelty ye have ruled them. And they were ſcattered, becauſe there is no Shepherd, and they became meat to all the beaſts of the field, when they were ſcattered.</hi> And in the eighth and tenth Verſes: The Lord ſwears by his life, that ſeeing his Flock was become a prey and meat to every beaſt of the field, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his Flock at their hands, that had been the cauſe of their ſcattering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But we do not look upon theſe as righteous men, if we did we would not moleſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though you do not, yet if God owns and accepts them as righteous, this will not excuſe your Sin. I have in part anſwered this already, and ſhall do it more fully, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>Plea</hi> 1ſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. We do not puniſh them for righteouſneſs ſake, but for keeping Conventicles, which is a thing we hate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The work you find them at when you come to their meetings, is Praying to God in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, giving God thanks, Preaching and Hearing God's holy Word; and for theſe things you go and inform againſt them, and raiſe Perſecution againſt them. What is, If this be not perſecuting men for righteouſneſs ſake? For Praying, Preaching and Hearing the Word of God are Duties commanded by God, as was proved before. And God's commands are all righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.72. <hi>All thy Commandments are righteouſneſs.</hi> So that when men are perſecuted for theſe things that are commanded of God, they are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What do you mean by keeping Conventicles? If you take Conventicles as <hi>Minſhew</hi> deſcribes a Conventicle when it is taken in an ill ſenſe, <hi>Pro conventu ſeditioſorum &amp; ſceleratorum;</hi> For a meeting of Seditious and wicked men; Theſe men whom you perſecute, abhor Conventicles taken in this ſenſe as much, and it may be more than you do. And if you call the Aſſemblies of theſe men Conventicles in this ſenſe, you are guilty of reproaching the ſervants and the ways of the living God; and ſo commit a double Sin, the one in reproaching, the other in moleſting them while they are ſerving the Lord. Remember there is a wo to them that call good evil, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the privacy of their meeting be that which you ſtile a Conventicle, then you will find the Diſciples of Chriſt at a Conventicle, and Jeſus Chriſt in the midſt of them ſpeaking peace to them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you.</hi> Here is a private Aſſembly of the Diſciples, they met in the evening, their doors were ſhut for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> And Chriſt Jeſus honoured this private meeting with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he came to them, he ſtood in the midſt of them, and ſaid, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> He did not chide them, and ſay, Sirs, what do you here? why do
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102521:11"/>you not meet in the Synagogue? why do you ſhut the doors? But ſpeaks peace unto them. Let thoſe conſider whether they be led by the Spirit of Chriſt, who if they hear of the ſervants of Chriſt met together, with the doors ſhut, for fear of their Enemies; Cry out, a Conventicle, a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and load them with reproaches, and ſtir up trouble and perſecution againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Informers</hi> do offend thoſe little ones that believe in Jeſus Chriſt. And that is ſuch a dangerous ſin, that a man had better have a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone hang about his neck, and be caſt into the depths of the Sea, than to offend the leaſt and meaneſt of all thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.6. <hi>whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Obſerve here,</p>
               <p>1. What a dangerous ſin it is to offend the meaneſt perſon that believeth in Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch a man had better have a milſtone hung about his neck and be drowned in the depths of the Sea. If a man were caſt into the depth of the Sea, though he had no weight upon him, though he had great skill in ſwimming, he would certainly be drowned. But if a man had a great ſtone, a milſtone tyed about his neck and were caſt into the depths of the Sea, he would ſink ſuddenly and violently to the bottom of the Sea, and it would not be in the power of his friends to recover him again. And who would be in this mans condition to gain the whole world? Yet they that offend them that believe in Chriſt, are in a worſe condition than ſuch a man as is drowned in the deepeſt place in the Sea with a milſtone about his neck; for it is not ſaid, it were equally good, but it were better for him to have a milſtone hung about his neck, and be drowned in the midſt of the Sea, than offend thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. The Nature of the ſin; It is not ſaid whoſoever ſhall kill them, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall impriſon them, but whoever ſhall offend them.</p>
               <p>3. The perſon offending that is put in this evil condition by his offence. Every one whoever he be that ſhall offend, <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend.</hi> It reacheth all perſons in all ages and generations, of all ranks and conditions.</p>
               <p>4. The perſons whom it is ſo dangerous to offend, and they are ſuch as believe in Jeſus Chriſt, any one of them, even the leaſt and meaneſt of them; <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me.</hi> Now there are in theſe Aſſemblies to which the <hi>Informers</hi> come, and againſt which they raiſe up perſecution, many that do believe in Jeſus Chriſt. They do all of them profeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and many of them do by their works ſhew forth their Faith, and give good evidence that they do from their hearts believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It remains now to be proved that theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> and thoſe that joyn with them, are guilty of offending ſuch as believe in Chriſt; which will eaſily be manifeſted, if we do but underſtand what is meant here by Offending one of theſe little ones which believe on Jeſus Chriſt. By Offending, we are here to underſtand, as I conceive, whoſo ſhall offer any wrong, do any injury, whoſo ſhall afflict or trouble the leaſt or meaneſt of thoſe which believe in Jeſus Chriſt. And that this is the genuine ſenſe and meaning of this place may be proved.</p>

               <p>1. From the coherence of the words with what goes before. To offend here is oppoſed to receiving, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little child in my name, receiveth me. But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believeth in me,</hi> &amp;c. Now by receiving is meant, all kind of benefits that are for Chriſt's ſake beſtowed on ſuch perſons, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well obſerves. <hi>Vox</hi>

And <hi>Maldonate</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of <hi>Chryſostome</hi> upon this place, <hi>Scandalizare hoc loco non eſt ut alias, malum praebere exemplum; Sed injuriâ afficere.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus uſing this word of his Diſciples being offended, interprets their being offended to be their being ſcattered from him, when <hi>Judas</hi> came with Officers and Soldiers to apprehend him; they being afraid they ſhould ſuffer alſo, were ſcattered and diſperſed one from another, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.31. <hi>Then ſaith Jeſus unto them, All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night; for it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> If Offending be taken for ſcattering abroad, how doth this fall in with the practice of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> when they come with Officers and Soldiers, and ſeize upon thoſe that are Preaching the Word of God, and ſcatter and diſperſe the ſheep of the flock? are not they guilty of offending thoſe little ones that believe in Chriſt?</p>
               <p>3. This Interpretation, that a man had better have a milſtone hung about his neck and be drowned in the depth of the Sea, than to offer any wrong or bring trouble and affliction upon the meaneſt of thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, is agreeable to other places of Scripture, which ſet out the greatneſs and danger of their ſin, who ſhall preſume in their hearts to afflict or wrong any perſon though never ſo mean, though a deſolate widow, though a fatherleſs child, ſuch as can't plead their own cauſe, and have none other to plead for them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.22, 23, 24. <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow or fatherleſs child. If thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry. And my wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wives ſhall be widows and your children fatherleſs.</hi> God is greatly offended with ſuch as afflict others. Mark the words, <hi>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow or fatherleſs child.</hi> It's not ſaid widows and fatherleſs children; but any widow or fatherleſs child. It is not ſaid, if thou afflict them greatly, but <hi>if thou afflict them in any wiſe.</hi> It is not ſaid, if they cry mightily, but <hi>if they cry at all unto me.</hi> It is not ſaid, mine anger ſhall be kindled, but my anger ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword. Now it's an aggravation of our ſin, when thoſe whom we afflict are gracious perſons, ſuch as believe in Jeſus Chriſt; If <hi>Moſes</hi> then told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if they did in any wiſe afflict any widow or fatherleſs child, God's anger would wax hot againſt them, and he would kill them with the ſword. Our Lord Jeſus might well ſay, whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me, it were better for him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102521:12"/>that a milſtone were hung about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the Sea. Now theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> do not only offend and bring affliction upon one or two; but upon whole Aſſemblies of thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt. And though they conſider it not now, yet at the day of Judgment when they muſt appear before Jeſus Chriſt, to give him an account of all things done in the body; they ſhall wiſh that at ſuch times as they went to break up and moleſt the Aſſemblies of the ſervants of Chriſt, a milſtone had been hung about their necks, and they had been drowned in the depth of the Sea.</p>
               <p>If any one ſhall not acquieſce in this Interpretation, but ſhall contend for another ſenſe of the words; namely, that by offending is meant cauſing to offend; though this ſeems not agreeable to the context; yet even this Interpretation will reach the <hi>Informers</hi> alſo. For they cauſe many to offend by their practiſe: As,</p>
               <p>1. They bring down Officers, ſome of which are not ſatisfied in their Conſciences to moleſt theſe meetings; yet their Faith being not ſtrong enough to withſtand the temptation, they are enſnared by theſe men to wound their own Conſciences by ſinning againſt the light of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>2. They lay a ſtumbling-block before the weaker Chriſtians that frequent thoſe Aſſemblies to ſay and do irregular things to preſerve themſelves from ſufferings.</p>
               <p>3. By ſcattering and diſſipating theſe Aſſemblies, they expoſe weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be led away by erroneous perſons, who lye in wait for ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe are to draw them into their nets.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Arg.</hi> Forbidding thoſe to preach the Goſpel who are called of God to that work, is an exceeding great ſin both againſt God, and againſt man. The greatneſs of this ſin is ſet forth by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſins alway, for wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> Here are ſeveral things in this, and the former verſe that aggravate the ſin of theſe Jews, that did forbid the Miniſters of Chriſt to preach to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>1. They are ranked with thoſe bloody perſons that had killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets, as being of the ſame race and of the ſame Spirit. We do not read of any Prophet killed by thoſe Jews, that were then living; yet the Apoſtle ſaith, theſe Jews that forbade the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel had killed their own Prophets, becauſe they were one Spirit with them, that killed Chriſt; who both killed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and their own Prophets.</p>
               <p>2. Theſe Jews who forbade the preaching of the Goſpel, are branded with this note, <hi>They pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men.</hi> Erant vere <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith on the place. They were right <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as another ſaith. They were haters of God and men.</p>
               <p>3. Their ſin is further ſet out by the perſons whom they forbade; <hi>Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as Paul</hi> was called by Jeſus Chriſt, to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful putting me into the Miniſtry.</hi> Act. 26.13. <hi>I have appeared unto thee to this purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter.</hi> The perſons whom they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102521:13"/>forbade Preaching, were the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who were called of God to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>4. Their ſin in forbidding to preach the Goſpel, is further aggravated by this, that it hindereth the Salvation of Immortal Souls. <hi>Forbidding us to preach to the Gentiles that they might be ſaved.</hi> This is the greateſt injury and hurt that can be done by any man, to hinder his eternal Salvation. To kill his body is a crying ſin, which haſtens the vengeance of God; yet it is not ſo great a damage to a man as to hinder the ſaving of his Soul. I ſhall mention ſome paſſages out of Dr. <hi>Slater</hi>'s Comment on this Text: <q>Forbidding us to ſpeak, that is, to preach unto the Gentiles, ſo proving themſelves, <hi>Hoſtes humani generis, contrariant,</hi> enemies to all men. So are they all to be reputed, that hinder preaching of the Goſpel, as capital enemies of mankind: Needs any proof? They deprive us of the greateſt good, are enemies in the things that nearlieſt concern us. The Goſpel is God's power to Salvation. And <hi>fides ex auditu,</hi> how ſhall they believe without preaching? And how be ſaved without believing? Of other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, ſaid our Saviour, they can but kill the body, theſe are means to caſt body and ſoul into hell; by keeping from them the means of Salvation. And afterward draws this inference; If our Age and Nation have and ſuffer any of this kind of enemies and oppoſites to the eternal good of men; of whom we may ſay as Chriſt of the Phariſees, They have taken away the key of knowledge, neither entring themſelves, nor ſuffering thoſe that would; let them hear with whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> yokes them, even with the obſtinate ſhedders of our Saviour's blood, who neither pleaſe God, nor love any man. What vengeance God hath in ſtore for ſuch; I had rather themſelves ſhould ſeriouſly conſider, than give us occaſion to mention. But if the Lord would admit of no recompence for the blood of the body, but the blood of the ſlayer; how much ſorer vengeance hath he in ſtore for thoſe, that taint themſelves with the blood of Souls! It cryeth louder than the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>5. The forbidding to preach the Goſpel did fill up the meaſure of their ſins, and ſo did ripen them for deſtruction; for when the meaſure of a perſons or nations ſins are full, they are ripe for deſtruction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.18.</p>
               <p>6. Theſe Jews that forbade the preaching of the Goſpel brought upon themſelves the wrath of God in as dreadful a manner as ever came upon any people under heaven; <hi>wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>We have ſeen that it is a grievous ſin both againſt God and Man, a ſin
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102521:13"/>that brings wrath to the uttermoſt, to forbid thoſe that are called of God, to preach the Goſpel. Now let us ſee whether theſe <hi>Informers</hi> and their adherents are guilty of this ſin. That the Miniſters, which are uſually termed <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> are true Miniſters of Chriſt, called by him to Preach the Goſpel, hath been proved before. Now that theſe <hi>Informers</hi> are guilty of forbidding theſe Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel, is evident; For,</p>
               <p>1. They do procure Officers to come down to their Aſſemblies, and to call to them to deſiſt from Preaching; and to make them by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to leave off their work, and to ſcatter and diſperſe their Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>2. The way by which the Jews forbade the preaching of the Goſpel, was by raiſing perſecution againſt thoſe that did diſpenſe the Word: 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>And have perſecuted us, forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved.</hi> Thus do theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> they go to the Magiſtrates and incenſe them, and cauſe their Meetings to be diſperſed, and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Hearers to be fined in great ſums of Money.</p>
               <p>3. The Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Apoſtle uſeth here, is rendred ſometimes to hinder, or let, or withſtand and oppoſe; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.52. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.17. ſuch as by their actions ſeek to hinder the Preaching of the Goſpel, are under the guilt of forbidding to Preach; although they do not or ſhould not forbid it in words. And thus theſe <hi>Informers</hi> forbid the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt preaching, for they do what they can to hinder their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſome of them take great pains to travail up and down to carry on their evil deſigns.</p>
               <p>Though this ſin of the Jews in forbidding the Miniſters of Chriſt to Preach to the Gentiles that they might be ſaved, was an odious ſin; a ſin that brought down the wrath of God to the uttermoſt; yet they might have had many ſpecious pretences for their ſin, even as theſe <hi>Informers</hi> had for theirs (which I ſhall anſwer afterward) which yet did not excuſe them, nor keep off the wrath of God from them. I will mention ſome of them. As,</p>
               <p>1. We are not againſt Preaching, we have God's Word read and preached in our Synagogues every Sabbath-day, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every City them that preach him; being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</hi> It is thoſe mens preaching only that we forbid, that conform not to the Rites and Cuſtoms of <hi>Moſes; Forbidding us to ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Theſe men whom we forbid to ſpeak, are men prohibited by our Rulers to teach in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.17, 58. <hi>Let us ſtraitly threaten them that they ſpeak henceforth no more in this name. And they called them and commanded them not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the name of Jeſus.</hi> This ſtrait charge was given by the Rulers, Elders, Scribes, and the High-prieſts met in Council together, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. And conſequently by Authority Civil and Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>3. Theſe men do not only tranſgreſs the Commandments of the Rulers, but of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Diſciples they profeſs themſelves to be, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad their preaching to the Gentiles, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them, ſaying, Go not in the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans, enter ye not, but go rather to the loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102521:14"/>
               <p>4. Let the Gentiles come to us and be circumciſed, after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we will receive them, and then they may hear Preaching in our Synagogues every Sabbath-day, and be ſure of Salvation: <hi>For Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> Joh. 4.22.</p>
               <p>5. The Church of the Jews hath been a glorious Church; the only viſible Church in the world for ſome thouſands of years, and theſe men preaching to the Gentiles will diminiſh the glory of this famous Church. Their great Apoſtle teacheth us, that their riches will be our diminution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.12.</p>
               <p>6. Hitherto we have had but one Church, and now by their preaching to the Gentiles, we are like to have many more Churches erected.</p>
               <p>7. Theſe men are caſt out of the Synagogue by the general conſent of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.22. <hi>The Jews bad agreed already, that if any man did confeſs he was the Chriſt, he ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue.</hi> And may we not forbid an excommunicate perſon preaching?</p>
               <p>8. Neither theſe men that preach, nor the Gentiles that hear them, do obſerve the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law of <hi>Moſes.,</hi> which the Church of God hath obſerved ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.21. <hi>They are informed of thee, that thou teacheſt all the Jews that are among the Gentiles, to forſake Moſes; ſaying, that they ought not to circumciſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither to walk after the cuſtomes.</hi> The Jews might have pleaded theſe and ſeveral other excuſes for their forbidding the Apoſtles preaching to the Gentiles; yet none of theſe did keep off God's wrath from them. And therefore let not the <hi>Informers</hi> ſhrowd themſelves, and ſeek to hide their ſin under ſpecious pretences (which ſhall be enquired into more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly afterward); but lay to heart the greatneſs of their ſin in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring theſe Miniſters from preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, whereby men may be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> They that do not receive Chriſt's Miniſters, nor hear their words, ſhall be in a worſe condition than the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> at the day of Judgment: <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or city, ſhake off the duſt of your ſeel; verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah at the day of Judgment than for that city.</hi> The men of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> will be in a very miſerable condition at the day of Judgment, for they were exceeding great ſinners: <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The men of Sodom were wicked and ſinners before the Lord exceedingly.</hi> They were ſuch ſinners as that the Lord rained down fire and brimſtone upon them. And that fire which conſumed the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> was a forerunner, a declaration, and teſtimony to the world of the eternal fire, which they and other impenitent ſinners ſhould ſuffer in the other world: <hi>Jude</hi> v. 7. <hi>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> And And yet our Lord Jeſus who beſt underſtood how every man's caſe ſhall go at the day of Judgment, in regard he himſelf is the Judge of the world, aſſerts it for an undoubted truth, <hi>(verily I ſay unto you)</hi> that it ſhall be more tolerable at the day of Judgment, for the Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> than for them that do not receive thoſe Miniſters whom he ſends, or do not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102521:14"/>hear the Word they Preach. And if ſo, how dreadful will the condition of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> and their Adherents be at the day of Judgment, who do not only not receive the Miniſters of Chriſt, nor hear the Word they Preach; but endeavour to ſuppreſs their preaching, and will not ſuffer thoſe that would hear and embrace them to attend upon their Miniſtery, perſecuting them that Preach from houſe to houſe, which is a greater ſin, than barely not to receive the Preachers of the Word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> We do receive Chriſt's Miniſters, and do embrace his Goſpel, although we hear not theſe men, neither ſuffer others to hear them; but do what we can to ſuppreſs them. And therefore the fore-mentioned Scripture doth not touch us.</p>
               <p>1. Though you receive the Goſpel of Chriſt with your ears, yet your oppoſition that you make againſt the Miniſters, ſhews you have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Goſpel of Chriſt into your hearts. For this makes the woolf lye down with the lamb, and keeps the Aſp and the Cockatrice from hurting the ſucking child, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11. And makes the briar to become a mirtle-tree, and the thorn a firr-tree, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.11.13.</p>
               <p>2. Perſecuting thoſe that preach and hear the Goſpel, is a greater ſin, than not to receive the Miniſters of Chriſt, nor hear their words; And if you be one of thoſe that perſecute the Miniſters of Chriſt, this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will do more than touch you; it will take hold of you, and fall heavier upon you than if all the rocks and mountains were caſt upon you.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Arg.</hi> The Judgments threatned and executed upon them that by their informing againſt, and betraying the people of God into the hands of their enemies have brought them into trouble, do plainly evince the greatneſs of the <hi>Informers</hi> ſin. I paſs over the remarkable Judgments that have been executed on this generation of men in our days; if any one would be at the pains to make a collection of them, it might be a warning to others. But I ſhall wave theſe, and mention only ſome examples out of the Scripture, the truth whereof is queſtioned by no man, that believeth the Scripture to be the Word of God. <hi>Doeg</hi> turned <hi>Informer,</hi> and informed againſt <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt, for entertaining <hi>David</hi> at his houſe, and enquiring of God for him, and giving him Victuals, and giving him the Sword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.9, 10. And by this information he ſo incenſed <hi>Saul,</hi> that he ſlew thoſe Prieſts that had entertained <hi>David.</hi> But now mark what a grievous curſe fell upon this <hi>Informer, Pſ.</hi> 52.5. <hi>God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever, be ſhall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place, and root thee out of the land of the living.</hi> That this curſe is denounced againſt <hi>Doeg</hi> for informing againſt <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> for entertaining <hi>David</hi> at his houſe, is evident from the title of the Pſalm: <hi>A Pſalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and ſaid unto him, David is come to the houſe of Ahimelech.</hi> The curſe denounced againſt <hi>Doeg</hi> is very dreadful, conſiſting of theſe branches.</p>
               <p>1. Eternal deſtruction; and that from the hands of God, <hi>God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever.</hi> As he had been the deſtruction of the Lord's Prieſts, ſo God ſhould deſtroy him, but with a more terrible deſtruction; they were deſtroyed with a temporal deſtruction, but he ſhall deſtroy thee for ever.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102521:15"/>
               <p>2. God threatens to take him away, and pluck him from his dwelling-place, which words ſpeak his anger, yea, hot diſpleaſure, and that is very dreadful. <hi>David</hi> was afraid that God ſhould deal with him in his anger. <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot diſpleaſure.</hi> But as for <hi>Doeg,</hi> the words ſpeak God to be full of fury againſt him. He ſhall-take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place.</p>
               <p>3. Deſtruction to him and all that belong to him. <hi>He ſhall root thee out of the land of the living.</hi> He ſhall utterly ruinate thee and thine; leaving thee neither root nor branch; or the rooting him out of the land of the living, may refer to the depriving him of eternal life. Let then the <hi>Doegs</hi> of our age conſider this dreadful curſe, who if they ſee, or can hear of an houſe where the Miniſters of Chriſt are praying to God, or giving the bread of life to hungry Souls, they go and tell the Magiſtrates, and get Warrants to diſtrain and get away their goods from them. What became of thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> who finding him at Prayer, went and accuſed him to the King as a tranſgreſſour of the Law, and got him caſt into the Den of Lions? By the juſt judgment of God, theſe men and their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were caſt into the Den of Lions, and rent a-pieces, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.11.13.24. Theſe <hi>Informers</hi> do the like in our dayes, if they find the ſervants of God Praying and Preaching, they go and accuſe them to the Magiſtrate, and get them puniſhed; and may they not juſtly fear, that though they have no puniſhment here, the King of Kings will caſt them into a worſe place than the Den of Lions at the day of Judgment; even into the bottomleſs pit, where they ſhall be tormented of roaring Lions for ever and ever? <hi>Haman</hi> who informed againſt the Jews, and got a decree to deſtroy them, came to a miſerable end, he dyed upon a pair of Gallows fifty foot high. But above all other examples, I would have theſe <hi>Informers</hi> take notice what befel <hi>Judas</hi> for informing againſt Chriſt. He fell into ſuch a woful condition, that it had been good for him that he had never been born, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.24. After he had betrayed Chriſt, he was in ſuch a diſtreſſed condition, that he was weary of his life, and went away and hung himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.5. After he had hung himſelf, he fell down headlong and burſt aſunder, and his bowels guſhed out, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.18. And after he was dead, and his Soul was out of his body, it was carried into hell-torments, <hi>v.</hi> 25. See <hi>Piſc.</hi> Now what was it that this <hi>Judas</hi> did to Jeſus Chriſt? he did not accuſe him to <hi>Pilat,</hi> he did not nail him to the croſs, he did not thruſt a ſpear into his ſide; but this he did, he betrayed him into his enemies hands by diſcovering who, and where he was. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Chriſt to warn us of Apoſtacy, ſaid, Remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife. So may I ſay to <hi>Informers,</hi> Remember <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Why do you tell us of <hi>Judas?</hi> he was a damned wretch, we curſe him to the pit of hell, for betraying our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; we would have been torn in pieces, and ſuffered a thouſand deaths, rather than we would have done ſuch an act as <hi>Judas</hi> did; we abhor <hi>Judas</hi> as much as any man upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. You do the ſame thing in effect, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, and in judging him you condemn your ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. For our Lord Jeſus accounts that they which perſecute his members, perſecute him: <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid, who art thou Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102521:15"/>Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. Saul</hi> did not perſecute Jeſus Chriſt in his own perſon, for he was at God's right hand out of <hi>Saul</hi>'s reach; but he perſecuted the members of Chriſt, and the Lord Jeſus counted himſelf perſecuted in the perſecution of his members; what is done to the leaſt of his members, he takes as done to himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.40. Now as <hi>Judas</hi> did, he was guide to them that took Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.16. He knew the place where Chriſt was, and got Officers and Soldiers to go along with him; ſo do ye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are in ſome reſpects worſe than <hi>Judas;</hi> for <hi>Judas</hi> repented of what he had done: He made an open confeſſion of his ſin, he made reſtitution of the Money he had taken; you do none of theſe things. In ſtead of your repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you glory in your ſin, and are more and more hardened in your evil courſes. <hi>Judas</hi> did not bring Officers to take Chriſt whilſt he was Preaching to the people, or Praying to God: He did not diſturb him in his worſhip; but you come in the time of Prayer and Preaching the Word, as though you neither feared God, nor regarded Man; and in a prophane manner ruſh upon theſe men while they are ſerving God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Even thus the Scribes and Phariſees of old ſeemed to diſdain their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, killing the Prophets, and ſaid, If they had lived in their days, they would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets, and they builded their tombs, and garniſhed their Sepulchres, pretending to honour them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.29, 30. Yet they killed our Lord Jeſus, and the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Arg.</hi> The very neglecting acts of mercy towards the Members of Chriſt, as not feeding them when they are hungry, not clothing them when they are naked, the not-viſiting them when they are ſick and in priſon, will cauſe the Lord Jeſus to caſt men among the devils, into the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.41, 42, 43, 44, 45. To take away by violence the food and the rayment of the Members of Chriſt, is a greater ſin, than not to feed them when they are hungry, and not to cloth them when they are naked. To throw them into Priſons, and thereby to impair their health is a greater ſin, than not to viſit them when ſick or in priſon. If they ſhall be curſed by Jeſus Chriſt, and be caſt into everlaſting fire among the Devils, who do not feed, cloath, and viſit the Members of Chriſt, when hungry, ſick, and in priſon, nor take them in when ſtrangers; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall theſe <hi>Informers</hi> and their Adherents be thought worthy of at the day of Judgment, who do take away the food and rayment of the Members of Chriſt, and will not ſuffer them to dwell in peace in their own houſes, but thruſt them into priſon, and that for righteouſneſs ſake?</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Arg.</hi> Theſe men have been ſeveral years under affliction, having ſuffered the loſs of their livelyhoods, and been expoſed to other troubles; and it is greatly diſpleaſing unto God, that affliction ſhould be added to his people when they are under affliction, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15. <hi>I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen that are at eaſe; for I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped forward the affliction.</hi> Had you a love to theſe men, you would pity them under their affliction, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.14. <hi>To him that is afflicted pity ſhould be ſhewed from his friend.</hi> Be it ſo that God hath a controverſie with them, it doth not become you to trample them under your feet, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 47.6.11.</p>

               <p n="8">8 <hi>Arg.</hi> As they are Miniſters of the Goſpel, your ſin is exceeding great in hindring them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, and perſecuting them for Preaching the Goſpel. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To miſuſe the Lord's Meſſengers and his Prophets, is a ſin that brings down wrath without remedy: 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.15, 16. <hi>And the Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers; but they mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of God aroſe againſt theſe men, until there was no remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2e</hi> God will ſmite through the loins of thoſe that riſe up againſt his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.12. <hi>Bleſs, Lord, his ſubſtance, and accept the work of his hands; ſmite through the loins of them that riſe up againſt him, and of them that hate him; that they never riſe again.</hi> This is <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prayer, which he puts up for <hi>Levi,</hi> when he was bleſſing the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before his death, <hi>v.</hi> 1.8. The tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was ſeparated by the Lord to bear the Ark of the Lord, and to Miniſter to him, and to bleſs in his name, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.9. And therefore what is here ſpoken of <hi>Levi,</hi> belongs to all the Miniſters of the Goſpel; what <hi>Moſes</hi> prays for in the behalf of <hi>Levi,</hi> that God will do to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and to them that riſe up againſt them; He will bleſs their ſubſtance, and accept their works, <hi>he will ſtrike through the loins of them that riſe up againſt them.</hi> And what is that?</p>
               <p>1. He will give them a fatal ſtroke, he will give them ſuch a deadly wound, that they ſhall never recover it, he will break in pieces their power and ſtrength. The loins may ſignifie a mans ſtrength, <hi>Joh.</hi> 40.16. <hi>Lo, now his ſtrength is in his loins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He will not only puniſh themſelves in a dreadful manner; but he will viſit this their ſin upon their poſterity, from generation to generation; perſecuting the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is a ſin which God viſits not openly upon the fathers, but the children, and the childrens children unto the third and fourth generation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. The loins does ſignifie a mans poſterity, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Thy Son that ſhall come out of thy loins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The loins ſignifie ſometimes the mind or underſtanding; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Gird up the loins of your mind.</hi> And if loins be taken in this ſenſe, the meaning is, Lord give them up to a reprobate mind, and that is a ſore judgment, and a very dreadful token of the wrath of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.28. And it's uſual with the Lord to ſmite the enemies of his Miniſters with this judgment. And it's rare if ever ſuch perſons riſe again, that are thus ſmitten of God. Now thoſe whoſe loins God will ſtrike through that they riſe not again, are ſuch as hate, and ſuch as riſe againſt the Sons of <hi>Levi:</hi> that is, the ſecret and the open enemies of the Miniſters of the Goſpel. There are ſome that hate them, but conceal their hatred, theſe are ſecret enemies; and there are ſome that manifeſt their hatred by riſing up againſt them, theſe are open enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are Chriſt's Embaſſadors ſent into the world to treat of peace between God and men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though he did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> What injuries are done to an Ambaſſador of an earthly Prince, he takes them as ill as if they were done to his own perſon: If the Ambaſſador be reviled, plundered, impriſoned, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102521:16"/>in the delivery of his meſſage; the Prince takes this as ill, and will puniſh it as ſeverely as if it had been done to himſelf. So doth the King of Heaven, who is King of Kings, take all injuries done to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors as done againſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who hath given us his holy Spirit.</hi> And what is ſaid of deſpiſing is true of all other affronts and injuries which are offered to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Lord takes them as done to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If theſe men were Prophets, or Apoſtles, and could work miracles; if then we ſhould moleſt them; we ſhould think our ſelves worthy of death. One might fear the wrath of God ſhould break forth upon us; but they are but ordinary men, ſubject to the ſame paſſions and infirmities as other men are; and therefore we can't think there is ſuch danger in oppoſing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers are of God's ſending and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are of divine inſtitution, as well as Prophets and Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church; firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles:</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> It is God gives, and God ſets Paſtors and Teachers in his Church, as well as Apoſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles and Prophets, though holy men of God, and guided by an infallible Spirit; yet were but men ſubject to the like paſſions as we are. <hi>Elias</hi> was an eminent Prophet; yet is ſaid of him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Elias was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are. Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; yet when the men of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have adored them as Gods, and done Sacrifice to them; they cryed out, <hi>Sirs, why do you theſe things? we alſo are men of like paſſions with you,</hi> Act. 14.15. They that deſpiſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel in thoſe days, would have deſpiſed the Prophets and Apoſtles, had they lived in their days; for they that were enemies to the power of Godlineſs deſpiſed the Apoſtles and Prophets then, even as many do now the Miniſters of Chriſt. Take an inſtance of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who though he was full of the Holy Ghoſt, yet ſome thought and ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Some think of us, as though we walked according to the fleſh;</hi> v. 10. <hi>His letters ſay they are weighty and powerful; but his bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech contemptible.</hi> Many other vilifying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were given concerning this Apoſtle, which I forbear to mention.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may be a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet be able to work no miracles: <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a true Miniſter, (and lived in the time when the gift of miracles was frequently given) yet it's ſaid of him, <hi>John did no miracle,</hi> Joh. 11.41. And ſome that had the gift of miracles were deſtitute of true Grace, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.23, 24. And therefore we ſhould not decry a man as no Miniſter of Chriſt, becauſe he can't work miracles, eſpecially ſeeing working of miracles is now ceaſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Lord Jeſus would have every one of his Miniſters whom he ſends to Preach the Goſpel received with love and honour, and all kindneſs ſhewn to them, as well as to his Apoſtles and Prophets. And to engage us to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102521:17"/>an honourable, willing and chearful reception of them; he telleth us, that he will take it all one, when we receive his Miniſters, as if we received him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his Father: <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that receiveth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> It is not ſaid, He that receiveth my Apoſtles, or he that receiveth my Prophets; but he that receiveth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me. And that we may be aſſured thereof, he adds a double aſſeveration: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you.</hi> Hence I argue, If he that <hi>receiveth</hi> whomſoever Chriſt ſendeth, receiveth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then he that receiveth, or perſecuteth any of the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus, whom he ſends to preach his Goſpel, receiveth and perſecuteth the Lord Jeſus himſelf.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Arg.</hi> It is Satan that ſtirs up men to betray, perſecute, impriſon, and make war againſt the ſervants of Chriſt; when <hi>Judas</hi> took up a reſolution to betray Jeſus Chriſt, it was the Devil that put this motion into his heart, Joh. 13.2. <hi>The Devil having put it into the heart of Judas Iſcariot Simons ſon to betray him.</hi> When there is trouble raiſed up againſt thoſe that keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, it is the Devil that ſtirs up men to raiſe up perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. <hi>And the Dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> This action of betraying, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, and perſecuting the ſervants of Chriſt, is ſuch a fulfilling of the Devils will, and hath ſo much of the Devils nature in it, that the Holy Ghoſt calls the betrayers and perſecutors of the people of God by the name of Devils, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.70, 71. <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil? He ſpake of Judas Iſcariot, the ſon of Simon, for he it was that ſhould betray him, being one of the twelve.</hi> Why was <hi>Judas</hi> called a Devil? It was for betraying the Lord Jeſus: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Behold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon.</hi> The Devil did not appear in his own perſon, and hale theſe Saints into Priſon; but he ſtirred up evil-minded men to do his work, and they fulfilling his luſts, are called by his name. Did the <hi>Informers</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it was the Devil put it into their hearts to diſturb theſe Aſſemblies, where Prayer is made to God, and God's Word is Preached, it would ſtartle them, and make them draw back, unleſs they were wonderfully hardened in their ſin.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Arg.</hi> Theſe men whom you afflict and moleſt are righteous men; as hath been before proved. And it is a mighty ſin to afflict righteous and juſt men. There are different degrees of ſins, ſome are ſmall ſins, others great ſins, others mighty great ſins. This ſin of afflicting the juſt, is among thoſe that are mighty great ſins, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.12. <hi>I know your manifold tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and your mighty ſins, they afflict the juſt, they take a bribe, and they turn aſide the poor in the gate from their right.</hi> The Prophet having taxed <hi>Iſrael</hi> of being guilty of mighty ſins, and if any ſhould ask, what mighty ſins they were guilty of? he preſently adds, <hi>They afflict the just.</hi> See the greatneſs of this ſin in ſeveral particular?</p>
               <p>1. All the wrongs and injuries done to righteous men, the Lord takes as ill as if done againſt himſelf, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> The eye is the tendereſt part of the body, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102521:17"/>apple of the eye the tendereſt part of the eye; a touch on the apple of the eye is more grievous, more afflicting, than a blow on the back or hand; it is not ſaid, he that killeth you, he that beateth you with many ſtripes; but he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye; intimating that the ſmalleſt afflictions, the leaſt troubles that are brought upon righteous men, are exceeding grievous to God, he counts what is done to them, as done to the apple of his eye. There are no afflictions brought upon righteous men; but he eſteemeth himſelf afflicted in their affliction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted:</hi> when they are in miſery, their miſeries are not only grievous to them, but they grieve his Soul alſo, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.6. <hi>His ſoul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael.</hi> And what a monſtrous ſin is this, for a creature to preſume in his heart to do that which afflicts and grieves the Soul of God, in whom we all live, and move, and have our being; and to ſtrike at the apple of his eye!</p>
               <p>2. Righteous men are nearly related to God; they are his ſervants. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116.6. <hi>Truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant.</hi> They are his friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> They are God's children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by ſaith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They are members of Chriſt's body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular.</hi> And it muſt needs be an horrible ſin to abuſe, to impriſon, to fine, to hale out of their meetings, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the friends, the children of God, and the members of Chriſt; when they are about their Maſters work, when they are worſhipping and ſerving their heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord beareth a great love to righteous men, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 146.8. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> And how contrary is this to God's Will, that you ſhould afflict thoſe whom he loveth?</p>
               <p>4. Righteous men are bleſſings to the places where they live, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.11. <hi>By the bleſſing of the upright, the city is exalted,</hi> what was promiſed to <hi>Abraham? Gen.</hi> 12.2. <hi>I will bleſs thee, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing;</hi> belongs to all the members of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>So then they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> And therefore they that afflict and perſecute righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, are not only unthankful for, but they are enemies to their own good, for they partake of many bleſſings for righteous mens ſake. What <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 30.27. <hi>I have learned by experience that the Lord hath bleſſed me for thy ſake.</hi> The ſame might thoſe Villages, and Cities ſay, where righteous men dwell, did they obſerve the dealings of God with them; we have learned by experience that the Lord hath bleſſed us for theſe righteous mens ſake.</p>

               <p n="1">1. As it brings down National Judgments; one man's ſin may cauſe a whole Nation to ſuffer. <hi>Achan</hi>'s ſin brought God's wrath upon all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Did not Achan the ſon of Zera commit a treſpaſs in the accurſed thing; and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Iſrael, and that man periſhed not alone in his iniquity?</hi> What was <hi>Achan</hi>'s ſin which

When I ſaw among the ſpoils a goodly Babiloniſh garment, and two hundred ſhekles of Silver, and a wedge of Gold of fifty ſhekles weight; then I covered them, and took them, and behold they are hid in the earth, in the midſt of my tent, and the Silver under it.</hi> The ſin of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> ſeems to me equal, if not greater, and as likely to bring down wrath upon the Nation; as <hi>Achan</hi>'s ſin; and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. The men of <hi>Jericho</hi> were God's enemies, and they and their ſubſtance were accurſed of God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.17. <hi>The city ſhall be accurſed, even it, and all that are therein:</hi> But the righteous, and all they have, are bleſſed of the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Thy bleſſing is upon thy people;</hi> not only their perſons are bleſſed, but their ſubſtance alſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Bleſs, Lord, his ſubſtance.</hi> See alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.4, 5. Now is it not as great a ſin for theſe men to oppreſs God's friends who are the bleſſed of the Lord, and to take away their ſubſtance which is under the bleſſing of God; as it was for <hi>Achan</hi> to take away ſilver, and gold, and rayment from the men of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which were God's enemies; and both they, and all that they had, were under his curſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Achan</hi> committed his ſin ſecretly, he hid what he took in his tent. <hi>Behold, they are hid in the earth in the midſt of my tent.</hi> He laboured to cover his ſin; but theſe men declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom:</hi> They are not afraid to ſin openly in the ſight of all men. And the more openly and impudently a mans ſin is committed, the more provoking to God to ſend down his Judgments.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Achan</hi> confeſſed his ſin, and thereby gave glory to the God of <hi>Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 7.20. Theſe men glory in their ſhame, and will not be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their iniquity.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Achan</hi> was puniſhed for his treſpaſs, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtoned him with ſtones, and burnt his houſe with fire, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.25. But theſe men are ſo far from being puniſhed, that they oft-times go away with a reward. Another inſtance of a whole Nation ſuffering for the ſin of one man, we have in <hi>David</hi>'s caſe. <hi>David</hi>'s numbring the people, provoked God to ſend a Peſtilence, which in three days time, ſlew ſeventy-thouſand men, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.2.7. And <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joab,</hi> and to the Rulers of the People, <hi>Go number Iſrael from Beerſheba even to Dan; and bring the number unto me, that I may know it. And God was diſpleaſed with this thing; therefore he ſmote Iſrael,</hi> v. 14. <hi>So the Lord ſent Peſtilence upon Iſrael, and there fell of Iſrael ſeventy thouſand men.</hi> Let it be conſidered whether thoſe <hi>Informers</hi> that go to the Aſſemblies of theſe men, to take the names of thoſe that worſhip God in order to the puniſhing them for their ſerving God, do not ſin in as high a degree, as <hi>David</hi> did in the numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For,</p>
               <p>1. The numbring of the people was not without a preſident; for it was done by <hi>Moſes</hi> at God's appointment in the ſecond year after <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Num. 1, 2. But to number mens names in order to puniſh them for being preſent then, and where Prayer is made to God in the name of Jeſus
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102521:18"/>Chriſt, and God's Word preached, hath not been practiſed by any perſons that have occurred to my obſervation in reading the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>David</hi> might have pretended better things to have excuſed his ſin, than theſe <hi>Informers</hi> have for their practice. As by numbring the people he might ſee the accompliſhment of God's promiſe, who promiſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a great and numerous poſterity, and all the Generations from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> were but fourteen Generations, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.17. Now that there ſhould be a thouſand thouſand, and a hundred thouſand men that drew ſword, and four hundred threeſcore and ten thouſand in <hi>Judah,</hi> beſide <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> that were not numbred, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.5.6. When <hi>David</hi> heard this great number, he might have made this uſe of it, what a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is here of God's faithfulneſs and power, that from one, and him as good as dead, ſhould ſpring ſo great a multitude of men, beſides wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children. Beſides, he might have ſaid, what cauſe have I to be thankful to God that hath put ſuch honour upon me, to make me a King of ſuch a numerous people? <hi>For in the multitude of people is the Kings honour, Prov.</hi> 14.28. He might alſo judge it a point of prudence conducing to his credit and his peoples ſafety, to know his ſtrength, that having ſo many potent enemies on every ſide, he might judge when and with whom to make War and Peace, as it becomes a wiſe and wary Prince to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.31. But theſe things did not excuſe <hi>David</hi> from ſin, God ſaw an irregularity in <hi>David,</hi> whether it were pride, or curioſity, or neglecting the offering that was preſcribed, when the people was numbred, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.13, 14. I ſhall not determine.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>David</hi> was troubled in conſcience for his ſin, and made an humble confeſſion of it to God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>And Davids heart ſmote him after that he had numbred the people; and David ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done; and now I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant, for I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> But we hear of no remorſe from theſe men.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>David</hi> offended but once in this kind, but theſe men go on in their evil way, and often renew their ſin.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>David</hi> when convinced of his ſin, was willing to have ſuffered death, ſo that God would not proceed to puniſh <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>And David ſpake unto the Lord when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the people; and ſaid, Lo I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly; but theſe ſheep what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be againſt me, and againſt my father's houſe.</hi> Whereby it is evident that he had no evil deſign upon the people, when he cauſed them to be numbred. But theſe men that go to theſe Aſſemblies to take names, and watch them as they come forth, in order to the getting them to be puniſhed, make it manifeſt that they have a deſign upon them to do evil to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The actings of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> are prejudicial to the whole Kingdom; becauſe righteous men are the ſtrength of a Nation, and are bleſſings to the places where they live, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.5. <hi>The governours of Judah ſhall ſay in their heart; The inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of Hoſts their God,</hi> Prov. 11.11. <hi>By the bleſſing of the upright, the city is exalted.</hi> When <hi>Eliſha</hi> was dying, <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wept over him, and ſaid,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102521:19"/>
                  <hi>My Father, my Father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof,</hi> 2 King. 13.14. Intimating that <hi>Eliſha</hi> by his Prayers, was a greater ſecurity and protection to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than all the chariots and horſemen that were in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now if righteous men are bleſſings to a Nation, if they are the ſtrength and ſecurity of a Nation; the perſecuting and afflicting them, muſt needs be prejudicial to a Nations welfare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The perſecuting theſe men, weakens the Proteſtant, and ſtrengthens the Popiſh intereſt in this Nation: For theſe men both in their Preaching and Writing, have appeared eminently againſt the Popiſh Doctrine; and it's not long ſince that we were called both by the King and Parliament to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves by faſting for the growth of Popery in the Nation. And that which weakens the Proteſtant, and ſtrengthens the Papal intereſt, muſt be acknowledged to be prejudicial to the Nation, by all that are well affected to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The <hi>Informers</hi> are guilty of ſmiting their fellow-ſervants, and that is a provoking ſin; when a man without juſt cauſe ſhall ſmite his fellow-ſervant, eſpecially if he ſmite him for doing his Maſter's work, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.48, 49, 50, 51. But <hi>if that evil ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth his coming. And ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken. The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> I would mind the <hi>Informers</hi> of ſeveral things from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which do nearly concern them.</p>
               <p>1. Theſe are in God's account evil ſervants, that ſmite their fellow-ſervants without a cauſe. <hi>If that evil ſervant ſmite his fellow-ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. God uſually gives up ſuch as ſmite their fellow-ſervants to ſenſuality, that they prove ſottiſh perſons, companions of Drunkards. <hi>Smite his fellow-ſervant, and eat and drink with the drunken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Smiting fellow-ſervants brings ſwift and unexpected deſtruction. The ſwiftneſs of the judgment is implyed, in that God takes men oftimes in the beginning of their ſin. <hi>And ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervants.</hi> The unexpectedneſs of the Judgment in that ſometime he does not give a days, no not an hours warning: <hi>The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day, that the looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Utter deſtruction will be the portion of ſuch as ſmite their fellow-ſervants, <hi>And ſhall cut him a-ſunder.</hi> If a man be cut and ſlaſh'd in his body, he may be healed of his wounds, but if he be cut aſunder, he is deſtroyed without remedy.</p>
               <p>5. Such as ſmite their fellow-ſervants, ſhall have their portion among hypocrites in the bottomleſs pit, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. <hi>And ſhall appoint him his portion with hypocrites, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And why with hypocrites? It is, either becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretences ſuch may make of zeal, they are but hypocrites in God's account, that ſmite their fellow-ſervants; or it is, becauſe of all men hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſhall have the greateſt portion of torment in the other world, as being the chiefeſt of ſinners, in <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33.14.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102521:19"/>
               <p>If they reply, This Scripture doth not concern us <hi>Informers,</hi> but ſuch as have power in Church or State, and abuſe their power to the vexing of their fellow ſervants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant that <hi>Grotius</hi> expoundeth this place of Paſtors, who do either themſelves, or who ſtir up Magiſtrates to vex and deal cruelly with other Miniſters and Chriſtians, for reproving them for their corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or ſinful lives; or for differing from them in ſome circumſtantial things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be taken in this ſenſe, yet it will reach the <hi>Informers;</hi> for like ſins ſhall have like judgments.

                  </note>IF we did know or think that theſe were righteous men, we would not perſecute them to gain the whole world, but we look upon them as Phanaticks, Factious perſons, Schiſmaticks, Peſtilent fellows, Seducers of the people, Troublers of the Nation; yea, the very worſt ſort of men, and therefore we do think we well to perſecute them, and do what lyeth in our power to ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This was the ſame way which the Jews uſed to perſecute the Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; they ſaid all manner of evil againſt them falſely, and then perſecuted them not as righteous men, but as evil doers, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.11.12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake; rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven: For ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> So perſecuted they the Prophets; How? By reviling them, and ſpeaking all manner of evil againſt them falſly; and perſecuting them under the notion of evil doers, and not as righteous men. The Jews would not own that they ſtoned Chriſt for righteouſneſs ſake, or any of his good works; but gave out that he was a blaſphemer, and they ſtoned him for blaſphemy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33. <hi>The Jews anſwered him, and ſaid; For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, becauſe thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102521:20"/>
               <p n="2">2. When you have ſpoken all the evil you can of theſe Miniſters, that are called <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> you cannot ſay worſe of them than the Jews ſpake of the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; yet not only Jeſus Chriſt, but the Prophets and Apoſtles were righteous men. Do you look upon theſe Miniſters to be Phanaticks or Mad-men? So <hi>Paul</hi> was cenſured as a mad-man, <hi>Act.</hi> 26, 24. <hi>Paul thou art beſide thy ſelf, much learning hath made thee mad.</hi> Yea, the Jews thought and ſaid Chriſt was mad, and gave out that the Devil was in him, and wondred that any would go to hear him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Many of them ſaid, He is mad and hath a Devil, why hear ye him?</hi> Do you queſtion the authority of theſe Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel? So did the Jews queſtion Chriſt's <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.23. <hi>And when he was come into the Temple, the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and ſaid, By what authority doeſt thou theſe things, and who gave thee this authority?</hi> Will you not believe theſe men to be true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt? So it was with the Jews, they would not believe <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to be a Prophet of the Lord, but thought he made himſelf a Prophet. We find <hi>Shemaiah</hi> writing thus to <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Jer. 29.26, 27. <hi>The Lord hath made thee Prieſt inſtead of Jehoiada the Prieſt, that ye ſhould be officers in the houſe of the Lord; for every man that is mad, and maketh himſelf a Prophet, that thou ſhouldeſt put him in Priſon, and in the Stocks. Now therefore, why haſt thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himſelf a Prophet to you?</hi> Do you give out that it is not the Lord that ſtirs up theſe men to Preach the Goſpel, but the people ſet them on out of evil and ſeditious deſigns? So ſaid they of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 43.2, 3. <hi>Then ſpake Azariah, and Johanan, and all the proud men, ſaying unto Jeremiah; Thou ſpeakeſt falſly, The Lord our God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Go not into Egypt to ſojourn there: But Baruch thê ſon of Neriah ſetteth thee againſt us, to deliver us into the hand of the Caldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</hi> Do you look upon theſe Miniſters as peſtilent fellows, movers of ſedition, ring-leaders of the Sectaries? and do you inform againſt them as ſuch to the Governours? So did the Jews look upon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 24.1.5, 6. <hi>Tertullus informed the Governour againſt Paul. We found this man a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition among all the Jews through all the world, and a ring-leader of the ſect of the Nazarens, who alſo hath gone about to prophane the Temple.</hi> Do you look upon theſe as the troublers of the Nation? So did <hi>Ahab</hi> look upon <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 18.17. <hi>When Ahab ſaw Elijah, Ahab ſaid unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Iſrael?</hi> Are they aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as though they were enemies to the King? So was <hi>Elijah</hi> repreſented to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21.20. <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou found me, Oh mine enemy?</hi> Are they looked upon as none of the King's friends that ſhew kindneſs to theſe men, when they fall into their hands? Thus the Jews cryed out to <hi>Pilat,</hi> that if he releaſed Chriſt, he would be looked upon as no friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Joh. 19.12. <hi>From thenceforth Pilat ſought to releaſe him, but the Jews cryed out. If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſar's friend.</hi> Do you think theſe men are not fit to live in the Nation, nor in any other part of the world, and that it would do well if they were put to death? So the Jews thought and ſaid of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 22.22. <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit he ſhould live.</hi> Not to inſtance in more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102521:20"/>when you have vilified and reproached theſe Miniſters as much as poſſibly you can; you cannot eſteem or ſpeak worſe of them, than the bleſſed Apoſtles were eſteemed and ſpoken of in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>I think God hath ſet forth us Apoſtles laſt, as it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto death. For we are made a ſpectacle unto the world, and to angels and to men. We are fools for Chriſts ſake,—we are weak,—deſpiſed,—perſecuted, defamed. We are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcowring of all things unto this day.</hi> And therefore the reproaches of the world can be no evidence againſt them, that they are not righteous men, or true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your revileing and reproachful language that you give theſe men, is ſo far from excuſing your ſin in perſecuting them; that it is a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. For reviling language will ſhut a man out of the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know you not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived? Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Revilers are in the Catalogue of thoſe that ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. And if any think he may be a reviler, and yet go to Heaven, he deceiveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He that calleth his brother fool, is in danger of hell-fire, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.21. <hi>But I ſay unto you, whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of Judgment; and whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother Racha, ſhall be in danger of the Counſel: But whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of hell-fire.</hi> To call the ſervants of Chriſt factious, ſeditious perſons, is as bad or worſe than to call them fools. And therefore they that uſe this oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious language, are in danger of hell-fire. And I may add this further, if you would be partakers of the Kingdom of Heaven, you muſt not only your ſelves forbear to reproach men that fear God; but you muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor entertain the reproaches that you hear from others, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy tabernacle, who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? He that back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach againſt his neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It bordereth upon the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to ſpeak evil of thoſe men out of envy and hatred, concerning whom we are perſwaded and convinced in our Conſciences that they are righteous men, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.28, 29, 30. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, All ſins ſhall be forgiven unto men, and blaſphemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſoever they blaſpheme, but he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt; hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation; becauſe they ſaid he hath an unclean ſpirit.</hi> The occaſion of Chriſt's telling the Scribes, that the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, was a ſin that ſhould never have forgiveneſs, was this, <hi>Becauſe they ſaid he had an unclean ſpirit:</hi> Whenas they could not but be convinced by his Doctrine and his Works that he was a holy man. Hear what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith upon the place: <hi>Hâc comminatione uſus eſt Chriſtus, quia videbat illos agnoſcere intra ſe vim divinam; ſed invidiâ &amp; odio comminiſci calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, ut plebem averterent atque ita quod Dei erat, diabolo aſcribere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Enquire into the lives and converſations of theſe men, before you paſs ſuch hard cenſures upon them; and if you go to the places where they have lived, you ſhall find them well reported of for good Works. In the Colledges where they were Students, and many of them Fellows;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102521:21"/>you ſhall find they were ſober, peaceable, of good behaviour, trained up Pupils that were committed to their truſt carefully and faithfully, and have left a good name behind them. If you enquire in the places where they exerciſed their Miniſtery, you ſhall find they Preached ſound Doctrine, were of an exemplary converſation, lived peaceably with all men, had the hearts and affections of their people; and in their ſufferings have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed much patience and contentation: And what ground then is there for your loading them with reproaches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea.</hi> 2. Theſe men are not obedient to authority, but meet together to Preach and Pray contrary to the Laws of the Nation, and therefore we cannot look upon them as righteous men; but we count them rebels, and think we ought to do what we can to ſuppreſs them. We do not perſecute them for Praying and Preaching, God forbid we ſhould be ſo wicked. But the reaſon why we are ſo eager in perſecuting them, is, becauſe they break the Laws, and are not conformable to the Service and Ceremonies of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It hath been an old device of Satan and his inſtruments, to raiſe up, and caſt ſlanders upon men fearing God; as though they were rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious perſons, and diſobedient to Laws, when they have been imployed in the Service of God. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> went about to build the wall of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> the adverſaries of the Jews gave out words, that he was about to rebel againſt the King, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel againſt the King?</hi> So when the Miniſters Preach for no other end, but to convert Souls, and build up ſuch as are converted; their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries give out they are rebels againſt the King. The like accuſation was raiſed againſt the Apoſtles, when they Preached the Goſpel up and down the world; their enemies repreſented them, to be ſuch as walked contrary to to the decrees of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Act. 17.6, 7. <hi>Thoſe that have turned the world upſide down, are come hither alſo; whom Jaſon hath received, and theſe all do contrary to the decrees of Caſar.</hi> And more particularly againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 18.12, 13. <hi>The Jews made inſurrection with one accord againſt Paul, and brought him to the judgment-ſeat; ſaying, This fellow perſwadeth to worſhip God contrary to the Law.</hi> Act. 21.28. <hi>Men of Iſrael, help; this is the man that teacheth all men every-where, againſt the people, and the Law, and this place. Daniel</hi> was a man ſo eminent for Piety, that he is ranked with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> who had great power with God in Prayer, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. He had an Angel ſent to him from Heaven, who told him he was a man greatly beloved of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.11. He was ſo blameleſs, that his enemies that ſought occaſion againſt him, could find no fault with him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3. Yet this <hi>Daniel</hi> was accuſed for not regarding the King, and his Laws, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Daniel regardeth not thee, Oh King, nor the decree that thou haſt ſigned.</hi> This was the device <hi>Haman</hi> made uſe of againſt the Jews. He accuſed them to the King for breaking the Laws, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Their Laws are diverſe from all people, neither keep they the King's Laws; therefore it is not for the King's profit to ſuffer them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The worſt of men have had pretences for their vileſt practiſes. The Jews that went about to ſtone Chriſt, would not own it, that they ſtoned him for a good work, but pretended it was for blaſphemy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.32, 33.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102521:21"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus anſwered them, many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father; for which of theſe works do you ſtone me? The Jews anſwered him, ſaying, For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</hi> As the Jews ignorantly or maliciouſly called Chriſt's preaching blaſphemy, and pretended they would have ſtoned him; not for a good work, but for blaſphemy: So the <hi>Informers</hi> either ignorantly or maliciouſly call theſe mens preaching rebellion, and ſay they do not perſecute them for preaching, but for rebellion againſt the Laws. They that caſt out their brethren that trembled at God's Word, pretended God's glory; but the Lord ſaw that action proceeded from malice and hatred, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 66.5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; your brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my name ſake, ſaid, the Lord be glorified. But he ſhall appear to your joy and their ſhame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To repreſent theſe Miniſters as diſobedient to authority, and rebellious perſons, is a grievous calumny, and a great wrong to them: It is contrary to their profeſſed and declared principles, and contrary to their practice. For they believe and teach that every Soul ought to be ſubject to the higher Powers, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God. And therefore they obey Magiſtrates not only to avoid their wrath, but for Conſcience ſake. And for further evidence of the ſoundneſs of their judgment in this point of obeying Magiſtrates, they do fully concur with, and are ready to ſubſcribe, if called to it, unto the ſeven and thirtieth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which treats of the civil Magiſtrate. And if at any time it ſo fall out that the command of the Magiſtrate be contrary to the commands of God, if in ſuch a caſe they chooſe to obey God rather than men, they are not upon this account to be called rebels and contumacious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For,</p>
               <p>1. This was the practice of the Apoſtles, to obey God rather than men, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to bearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</hi> And in ſo doing, they did no more than what was their duty to do, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. <hi>We ought to obey God rather than men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When the Midwives were commanded by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to do that which was contrary to the command of God; it was not rebellion in them to go againſt the command of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But this action of theirs did proceed from the fear of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. <hi>But the Midwives feared God, and did not as the King commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Magiſtrate is the Miniſter of God for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. He is but the Miniſter of God, and the Miniſter of God for good; that is, all that he enjoyns muſt be for God's honour, and for a publick good. If he command any thing contrary to the command of Chriſt, and we obey him; we exalt him above God, we prefer the Servant before the Maſter.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe men are more obedient to Authority, and truer Subjects than many of their adverſaries that reproach them with diſloyalty, and rebellion. For many of thoſe men that cry out againſt theſe Miniſters for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Laws, make no ſcruple of breaking ſuch Laws of God and men, as are contrary to their luſts. There are good Laws eſtabliſhed in this Nation, againſt Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Symony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet many that are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102521:22"/>common Swearers, Drunkards, and live in other vices condemned by the Laws of God, the Laws of the Nation, and the light of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, cry up themſelves for obedient Subjects, and cry out againſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for not conforming to ſuch things as they are not ſatisfied are lawful for them to do; which have been for many years, and ſtill are controverted among learned men, not only of this, but of other Nations; and which they profeſs could they be ſatisfied in their Conſciences of their lawfulneſs they would yield obedience to them.</p>
               <p>5. As for thoſe that complain of theſe Miniſters preaching contrary to the command of the Magiſtrate; I would put them in mind of the ſtrict command that God hath given to thoſe whom he hath called to the work and office of the Miniſtry to Preach the Goſpel as they will anſwer the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof to himſelf, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt at the day of Judgment, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who will judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom, Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and patience.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Yea, wo is unto me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> Now if men forbid that which God commands, whom are we to obey, God or men? If any ſay this charge was given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that wo was pronounced againſt <hi>Paul;</hi> and that is nothing to theſe men: if theſe men had a charge from God to preach as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had, we ſhould not dare to oppoſe or hinder their preaching. I anſwer, This charge that was given to <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach the word, doth and will concern all Miniſters of the Goſpel to the worlds end, as well as it did him. As that promiſe given to <hi>Joſhua, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> is interpreted by the Holy Ghoſt to be ſpoken to all Chriſtians, to the end of the world, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. So this command given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a Miniſter of the Goſpel, concerns all the Miniſters of the Goſpel in all places, and all ages of the world. What was ſpoken to the Apoſtles as they were Chriſtians, belongs to all Chriſtians, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. <hi>And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch.</hi> And what was ſpoken to them as Miniſters of the Goſpel belongs to all Miniſters as well as unto them.</p>
               <p>6. As for them that charge theſe men with ſin, yea with rebellion for Praying and Preaching contrary to Law, I would mind them of the examples of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Apoſtles. There was a royal Law made by all the Preſidents of the Kingdom, the Governours, the Princes, the Counſellors, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains under a very great penalty; That no man ſhould ask a Petition of any God or Man, for the ſpace of thirty days, ſave of the King, and this decree was ſigned by <hi>Darius</hi> the King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.7, 8, yet when <hi>Daniel</hi> knew this decree was ſigned, he prayed three times a day, as his uſual cuſtom was, and did not omit the opening of the windows in the time of Prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was ſigned, he went into his houſe, and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jeruſalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks before his God as at other times.</hi> What think ye? Did <hi>Daniel</hi> ſin againſt God, and rebel againſt the King in praying contrary to the decree? If you think <hi>Daniel</hi> ſinned in giving ſuch an example to after-ages, to pray contrary to a decree made with ſuch a penalty; or if you think he ſinned that he kept
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102521:22"/>his wonted times, and would not ſo far comply with the decree, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear for a few days, or that he did not take other hours, or that he would not ſhut his windows, or pray ſo ſecretly and privately as none but his own Family ſhould know of it; you may be convinced of your miſtake from <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>My God hath ſent his angel, and hath ſhut the Lions mouth, that they have not hurt me; foraſmuch as before him innocency was found in me, and alſo before thee, O King, have I done no hurt.</hi> It is evident from theſe words, that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Praying to God in his uſual manner, contrary to the decree, was no ſin either againſt God, or the King. And is not Prayer a Duty now as well as in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s time? The Apoſtles had a ſtrict charge from the rulers of the Jews not to Preach in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Let us ſtraitly threaten them, that they ſpeak henceforth to no man in this name. And they called them, and commanded them not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the name of Jeſus.</hi> That this command to forbear Preaching, was given by the Rulers, we may ſee <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. yet after this ſtrict charge and ſevere command given by the rulers to the Apoſtles to ceaſe Preaching, they were as diligent as before in Preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.27, 28. <hi>And when they had brought them, they ſet them before the Councel, and the High-Prieſt asked them, ſaying, Did not we ſtraitly command you, that you ſhould not teach in this name, and behold, you have filled Jeruſalem with your Doctrine.</hi> And after they had been beaten for Preaching the Goſpel, and had received a new command, not to ſpeak in the name of the Lord Jeſus; They continued to take all opportunities to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt, both in the Temple and every Houſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 40, 41, 42. <hi>When they had called the Apoſtles and beaten them, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould not ſpeak in the name of Jeſus, and let them go. And they departed from the preſence of the councel, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name. And daily in the Temple and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Did the Apoſtles ſin againſt God, or rebel againſt their rulers, for preaching the Goſpel, when they were ſtraitly charged by their rulers not to Preach, and beaten becauſe they did not obey the command, and another command given them after that to leave Preaching, and yet they proceeded in their work? If any ſhall ſay or think the Apoſtles did ſin in ſo doing, all good Chriſtians will condemn their raſh judgment, and they may eaſily be refuted from <hi>Act.</hi> 4.29. After they had been commanded to ceaſe preaching, and threatned, they Pray to to God to aſſiſt them to preach the word with boldneſs. <hi>And now, Lord, behold their threatnings; and grant unto thy ſervants, that with all boldneſs, they may ſpeak thy Word.</hi> And they would not pray for aſſiſtance in that which was ſinful. And their boldneſs in preaching after their prohibition from the rulers of the Jews, is aſcribed to their being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpake the word with boldneſs.</hi> And that man is a blaſphemer, who ſhall ſay, the Apoſtles ſinned in preaching againſt the command of their rulers; whenas it was the Holy Ghoſt which gave them boldneſs to preach the Word of God. Beſides, they were encouraged to preach, after their rulers had forbidden them, and had impriſoned them for preaching contrary to their commands, by an Angel that was ſent from Heaven, that opened the Priſon-doors, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Go and ſtand, and ſpeak in the temple to the people all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102521:23"/>words of this life,</hi> Act. 5.9, 20. And when they were again brought before the rulers, and examined whether they did not know of that ſtrict charge they had given them, and were taxed with the diſobeying their command, <hi>Did not we ſtraitly command you, that you ſhould not teach in this name, and behold you have filled Jeruſalem with your Doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us?</hi> They juſtified their preaching, though they had diſobeyed their rulers commands, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Then Peter, and the other Apostles anſwered and ſaid, we ought to obey God, rather than man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Though the Apoſtles preached the Goſpel when commanded by the rulers to forbear preaching, theſe Miniſters muſt not follow their example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If all Chriſtians are not to imitate the Apoſtles, in what they did as Chriſtians; and the Miniſters of the Goſpel to imitate and follow their example in what they did as Miniſters; what is the meaning of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Epiſtle to the Paſtors and Saints at <hi>Philippi?</hi> Phil. 3.17. <hi>Brethren, be ye followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo as you have us for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And Ch. 4.9. <hi>Theſe things which ye have both learned, received, and heard and ſeen in me, do; and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> And of that command 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> brings in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s praying againſt the Law, and the Apoſtles preaching contrary to the command of the rulers to prove this concluſion, <hi>Leges humanae injustae non obligant ad obediendum;</hi> Humane Laws if injuſt, oblige not to obedience. And juſtifies <hi>Daniel</hi>'s praying, and the Apoſtles preaching, though both acted contrary to the Law with this reaſon, <hi>Nimirum, quia utrobique, quae prohibabantur erant res neceſſariae; illic cultus veri dei, hic concredita ipſis Evangelii praedicatio:</hi> Becauſe in both caſes the things which were forbidden, were neceſſary Duties; In <hi>Daniel</hi>'s caſe, the worſhip of the true God; in the Apoſtles caſe, the preaching of the Goſpel, which was committed to them. I conceive the ſame reaſon will juſtifie the praying and preaching of theſe men (if the <hi>Informers</hi> were able to prove there were Laws forbidding the ſame) for praying and preaching are <hi>Res neceſſariae,</hi> now as well as in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s and the Apoſtles times. And it cannot be denyed but their worſhip is <hi>cultus veri Dei,</hi> and that they being true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Concredita eſt ipſis Evangelii praedicatio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I would ask theſe clamorous perſons that do cry out of theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for praying and preaching contrary to the Laws of the Nation; and thereupon charge them with diſobeying Magiſtrates, and rebellion againſt the Law, what they judge of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s aſſertion in his <hi>Ductor dubitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> lib. 3. p. 32. <hi>Every Law made againſt Religion, or any thing of divine Sanction and Commandment, is void, and cannot oblige the Conſcience.</hi> And pag. 34. <hi>All ſuch things as are againſt the good of the Subjects, the Law it ſelf declares to be no Law, that is, more than the Superiour hath right or leave to do.</hi> Now is there not a divine Sanction for praying and preaching; is not praying to God in the Name of Chriſt, and preaching the Goſpel whereby men may be ſaved, for the good of the ſubject? If theſe men do nothing but what is agreeable to the Laws of God, and what is for a publick good, they are not to be charged as tranſgreſſors of the Laws. Hear alſo what Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> ſaith concerning obedience to ſuch Laws as are croſs to the Laws of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102521:23"/>God. <hi>Quicquid legi Dei, aut naturae lumine notae, &amp; cordibus inſeriptae; aut in verbo Scripto revelatae adverſatur, non eſt ob quodcunque, vel detrimentum proprium, vel proximo ſcandalum, vel praelati ſive gratiam promovendam, vel declinandum odium, vere Chriſtiano admittendum. Da veniam, Imperator, lu carcerem, ille gehennam: Sic olim veteres illi Chriſtiani.</hi> Whatſoever is contrary to the Law of God, either manifeſt by the light of Nature, and graven in the heart, or revealed in the Scriptures, a Chriſtian muſt not yield to, for avoiding any hurt whatſoever to himſelf, or for preventing the ſcandal of others, or for the gaining the favour, or avoiding the diſpleaſure of his Superiour. The Chriſtians of old were wont to ſay to the Emperor, when his command did croſs the command of God; Excuſe me, Sir, you may caſt us into Priſon, but God can caſt us into Hell. Both theſe Authors were great caſuiſts, and ſpeak as highly for obeying Authority as moſt men; they were both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the one in <hi>England,</hi> the other in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (neither to be ſuſpected of any favour to <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> that might in the leaſt ſway them to ſpeak in favour of their cauſe) yet both agree that ſuch Laws as are contrary to the Laws of God, or to the publick good, do not oblige the Conſcience. But that praying to God in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for things agreeable to the Will of God, and Preaching the Goſpel, are Duties commanded in the Word of God, and that they tend to a publick good, is ſo plain in the Holy Scriptures, that he that runneth may read of.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In caſes of neceſſity, the Ceremonial Law was diſpenſed with, and they that tranſgreſſed the Law, were accounted guiltleſs. It was not lawful for any man excepting the Prieſts to eat of the Shewbread, others were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to eat thereof by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet in a caſe of neceſſity, <hi>David</hi> and they that were with him, did eat of that bread contrary to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet were guiltleſs, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.3, 4. <hi>Have ye not read what David did when he was an hungred, and they that were with them; how he entred into the houſe of God, and did eat the Shewbread which was not lawful for him to cat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the Prieſts.</hi> Hence I would argue thus: If <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of neceſſity tranſgreſſed the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which was a divine Law, and yet was not charged with guilt; then if theſe men in a caſe of greater neceſſity tranſgreſs an humane Law (about Ceremonies and Religious Rites) they are no more culpable than <hi>David</hi> was. To clear this, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p>1. The ſaving of loſt Souls, and feeding hungry Souls with the bread of life is a greater good, and a more neceſſary work than giving Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread to <hi>David,</hi> and his companions when they were hungry.</p>
               <p>2. The Ceremonial Law was of divine Inſtitution, the Law that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth conformity to the Ceremonies now in uſe, is but an humane Law: And there is greater reverence due unto divine than humane Laws.</p>
               <p>3. There was no diſpute among the Jews whether the Ceremonial Law was to be obſerved by them; they knew and did believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from God; but the lawfulneſs of conformity hath been of a long time, and ſtill is a diſputable point; many Learned and Holy men are not ſatisfied therein.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102521:24"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But there is no neceſſity of theſe mens Preaching, (if their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were neceſſary, we ſhould have nothing to ſay againſt it) but the people may hear the Word Preached from conformable Miniſters, and therefore their Preaching is needleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Preaching of theſe men is neceſſary in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; which hath laid a neceſſity upon thoſe that are called to the office and work of the Miniſtry to preach the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>For neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is laid upon me; yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> Every man that hath received talents from the Lord muſt occupy theſe talents in the place and ſtation God hath ſet him in; till the Lord takes him off from his work, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.13. <hi>He called his ten ſervants, and delivered unto them ten pounds, and ſaid unto them, occupy till I come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The preaching of God's Word is of greater neceſſity than our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food, and if we be of <hi>Job</hi>'s mind, we ſhall eſteem it ſo, <hi>Job.</hi> 23.12. <hi>I have eſteemed the word of thy mouth, more than my neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ahimilech</hi> might have anſwered <hi>David</hi> in the like manner; <hi>David,</hi> though thou art hungry, there is no neceſſity I ſhould give thee the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, there are houſes enough, where there is bread enough, and to ſpare, whither thou may'ſt go, and be welcom; and yet neither <hi>Ahimelech</hi> is reproved, nor <hi>David</hi> for receiving the Shewbread.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great ignorance, the growth of Atheiſme, Prophaneneſs, Popery and other dangerous errors in this Nation, ſheweth a neceſſity of all the Miniſters in the Nation, both <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> (if there were twice as many as there are) to lay out themſelves to the utmoſt in preaching the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whereas the <hi>Informers</hi> plead they do not perſecute theſe Miniſters for praying and preaching, but for breaking the Laws of the Nation; this is but a vain excuſe: For,</p>
               <p>1. The work you find theſe men about, is no other work but praying to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for things agreeable to his Will; and preaching the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or ſome other religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and for theſe things you inform againſt them.</p>
               <p>2. If you found theſe men aſſembled at a Tavern with Bottles of Wine eating and drinking, and making merry, you would not moleſt them; or if you found them at a play-houſe, to ſee a Comedy Acted, you would not moleſt them; or if they were at a Coffee-houſe reading a Gazette, hearing or telling of news; or if you found them aſſembled at a Dancing-School, or at a Fair or Market to buy or ſell, you would let them alone; but if you find them praying or preaching, you then make what haſt you can to ſuppreſs their Meetings, and to incenſe the Magiſtrate againſt them. And yet will you ſay, you do not perſecute theſe men for praying and preaching?</p>
               <p>3. If it be your zeal for the Law that carries you out; why do you not inform againſt Whore-mongers, Drunkards, Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, and other prophane Sinners, who break the Laws of God and men? yea, why do you not pull the beam out of your own eyes (and inform the Magiſtrate your ſelves one of another, for the crimes againſt the Law that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102521:24"/>you are well-known to be guilty of) before you go to pluck the mote out of theſe mens eyes?</p>
               <p>4. Whether thoſe men break the Law in preaching and praying, as you pretend, ſhall be enquired in anſwer to another of your Pleas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 3. If theſe men would conform or leave preaching we would not moleſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though theſe men cannot conform to thoſe things which are impoſed and required of ſuch as enjoy Eccleſiaſtical promotions in this Nation; yet the <hi>Informers</hi> ought not to perſecute them for preaching the Goſpel, though they be ſuch as have a great zeal for conformity: For ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. Preaching the Goſpel is of greater neceſſity, than conformity to the Ceremonies, which are acknowledged by the greateſt Patrons of them to be but indifferent things.</p>
               <p>2. Following Chriſt and his Diſciples was of greater conſequence than conformity to that which is impoſed on ſuch as enjoy Eccleſiaſtical promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet when <hi>John</hi> ſaw one caſting out Devils, and out of his zeal to Chriſt forbade him, Chriſt reproved him for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.49. <hi>And John an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out Devils in thy name, and we forbade him, becauſe he followeth not with us; and Jeſus ſaid, Forbid him not; for he that is not againſt us, is for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Theſe men cannot conform to the Ceremonies, and thoſe other things which are impoſed on publick Miniſters without ſin. For ſuppoſe theſe men were under a miſtake, and there was nothing required, but what was lawful; yet they judging theſe things unlawful, they cannot comply with them without ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. <hi>To him that eſteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Theſe men conform to the Law of God, and to the Doctrine of the Church; though they do not conform to the Ceremonies of the Church, whereas many that conform to the Ceremonies of the Church are of debauched converſations, and live in the tranſgreſſion of the Laws of God, and ſome are of corrupt judgments. And the zeal of the <hi>Informers</hi> ſhould carry them out rather againſt ſuch as corrupt the Doctrine, than thoſe that ſcruple the Ceremonies of the Church (for the Doctrine of the Church, is of more value than all the Ceremonies, that being of a divine Revelation, theſe of humane invention; that being of neceſſity to Salvation, theſe being as the chief Patrons of them contend only for order and decency in the worſhip of God) and againſt ſuch as tranſgreſs the Laws of God, rather than thoſe that tranſgreſs (as they ſay) the Laws of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas the <hi>Informers</hi> would have theſe men leave Preaching, they cannot do ſo, unleſs they would bring upon themſelves the curſe of God and of men. There is a wo from God againſt ſuch as are called to preach the Goſpel, and yet neglect it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Yea, wo is me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> And men would curſe them alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth corn, the people ſhall curſe him; But bleſſing ſhall be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> The myſtical ſence of this Proverb, ſeveral interpreters underſtand of ſuch as withhold the publiſhing of the Word, they will bring a curſe upon themſelves; but they that diſpenſe it faithfully, ſhall receive
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102521:25"/>a bleſſing, <hi>De Doctrinâ &amp; cibo animorum intelligi poteſt juxta myſticum ſenſum, qui abſcondit talentum, &amp; non paſcit gregem ſibi commiſſum; Maledictus eſt, R. Baynus. Samuel</hi> thought he ſhould ſin, if he ſhould ceaſe praying for, and inſtructing the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Moreover, as for me, God forbid, I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right may;</hi> yet the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had rejected <hi>Samael</hi> from bearing rule over them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5, 7. So theſe men though they have been caſt out of their poſſeſſions, and from their publick places, they ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, if they ſhould ceaſe praying for, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the people, when the Providence of God puts opportunities into their hands, of praying with them, and teaching them the good ways of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 4. If theſe men can't ſatisfie their Conſciences without preaching, let them preach in their Families, and to four or five more of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and in ſo doing they ſhall fulfil the Law of God, and not tranſgreſs the Laws of the Nation; and then we will not moleſt them, but we cannot bear their numerous meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Several Reaſons may be given why theſe men do not content themſelves, nor can be ſatisfied in Conſcience to preach only to their own Families, and four or five more of their Neighbours. I will mention three or four.</p>
               <p>1. Their commiſſion runs to preach the Goſpel to every creature that is willing to hear them, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> Their commiſſion is not limited to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but reacheth every place, where God calls them; neither to a few perſons, but to every creature that is willing to be taught by them.</p>
               <p>2. They are commanded as they have opportunity, to do good to all men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good to all men.</hi> And they account the greateſt good they are able to do for any perſons, is to preach the Goſpel to them; Spiritual alms are to be extended as far as thoſe which concern the outward-man: And the command there to ſuch as have ability, is, <hi>Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight.</hi> Luk. 6.30. <hi>Give to every man that asketh of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Our Lord Jeſus taught all that reſorted to him; though they came in great multitudes, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.13. <hi>All the multitude reſorted to him, and he taught them:</hi> Mark 10.1. <hi>And the people reſort unto him again, and as he was wont he taught them again.</hi> And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preached in his own hired houſe, he received all that came to him, and forbade none, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.30. <hi>Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired houſe, and received all that came unto him, and preached the Kingdom of God.</hi> And we are to imitate our Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles. Our Lord Jeſus was ſo far from forbidding multitudes reſorting to him, that the more people came to him, the more his bowels of compaſſion were moved towards them, and the more pains he took to inſtruct them, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.31. <hi>And Jeſus when he came out, ſaw much people, and was moved with compaſſion towards them; becauſe they were as ſheep not having a ſhepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</hi> Should theſe men ſhut up their bowels of compaſſion, and ſhut their doors;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102521:25"/>when they ſee much people reſorting to them, How ſhould they be of the ſame mind, and the ſame Spirit that was in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>4. The more they preach to, the more Souls are like to be ſaved by their Miniſtry. And it is the duty of a Miniſter of the Goſpel to ſave as many Souls as he can, from eternal deſtruction. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to preach to all, and to carry himſelf as a Servant to all, that he might gain the more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet I have made my ſelf a ſervant to all, that I might gain the more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 5. We have a Law for what we do, when we inform againſt theſe men, and cauſe them to be fined, and their Meetings to be broken up; we do nothing, but what is according to the Law: And therefore we hope we do not do evil in perſecuting theſe men, and ſuppreſſing their Meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſe you had a Law for what you do, yet that would not juſtiſie your actings, nor excuſe your ſin. The Jews pretended they had a Law to put Chriſt to death; and that by that Law, he not only might, but ought to be put to death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Jews anſwered him, we have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die; becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> Yet for putting Chriſt to death, the vengeance of God fell upon them and hath continued upon their poſterity in a moſt dreadful and amazing manner, above ſixteen hundred years. <hi>Paul</hi> had authority to diſturb the Meetings of the Diſciples, and impriſon them; he had a commiſſion from the High Prieſt to impriſon all of that way, which was cryed out againſt in thoſe days, as much as <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> are in theſe days, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>And Saul yet breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord, went unto the High Prieſt, aad deſired of him Letters unto the Synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>And here he hath authority to bind all that call upon thy name.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding his Letters and authority, Jeſus Chriſt cryes out of him as guilty of perſecution, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> to plead for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Golden Calves, yet that did not ſecure them from God's Judgments, but he threatens them with deſolation for their ſin, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.13 16, <hi>Therefore alſo will I make thee ſick in ſmiting thee, in making thee deſolate in ſmiting thee.—For the Statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the houſe of Ahab, and ye walk in their counſels, that I ſhould make thee a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Inhabitants thereof an hiſſing. Ephraim</hi> had a Commandment from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to worſhip the Golden Calves, yet this did not excuſe <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Sin; but God waſted <hi>Ephraim</hi> with ſecret and open Judgments, for walking willingly after that commandment; being both as a Moth and a Lion to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in judgment; becauſe he willingly walked after the commandment; Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the houſe of Judah as rottenneſs.</hi> The commandment that <hi>Ephraim</hi> walked willingly after, for which he is thus threatned, as alſo <hi>v.</hi> 14, is by moſt interpreters, both ancient and modern, underſtood of the commandment that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> gave the ten Tribes concerning the Golden Calves; as <hi>Rivet</hi> notes on the place. <hi>Hebraei interpretes &amp; noſtrorum plaerique id referunt ad mandatum Jeroboam de colendis vitulis, &amp; altaribus nobis erigendis.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:102521:26"/>The Papiſts that burnt the Martyrs, plead Law for what they did; yet all Proteſtants abhor and condemn their bloody practiſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may execute the Law, and yet be a ſinner in the ſight of God, if that which he doth, be done from an evil principle, or for an evil end: As for inſtance; Though you ſhould do nothing againſt theſe men, but what is according to Law; yet if your actings againſt them proceed from malice or hatred, or from a covetous principle to get their eſtates, or from enmity againſt Religion, or any ſuch like evil principle; your actings are abominable in the ſight of God. When <hi>Jehu</hi> deſtroyed the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he did that which was agreeable to the Law of God, he did according to all that was in the heart of God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. yet becauſe <hi>Jehu</hi>'s heart was not right in the ſight of God, becauſe he ſought his own ends, and not the glory of God in what he did, he was guilty of blood in the ſight of God; And God threatned to avenge the blood of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which was ſhed in <hi>Jezreel</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> Hoſ. 1.4, <hi>I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</hi> By the blood of <hi>Jezreel</hi> underſtand <hi>Ahab</hi>'s 70 Sons, which were ſlain at <hi>Jehu</hi>'s appointment by the Rulers of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and all the remainder of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s houſe, whom <hi>Jehu</hi> ſlew in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> 2 K. 8.10.1, 7, 11. Now if a man may fulfil the Law of God, and yet fall under the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, for doing what God commands, for corrupt and ſinful ends; then much more may a man execute the Laws of men, and thereby incur diſpleaſure of Almighty God, for making uſe of, and proſecuting that Law from evil principles, and for ſinful and corrupt ends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law which <hi>Informers</hi> make uſe of to perſecute theſe men, is capable of ſuch an interpretation, as it will not touch theſe men or their Meetings. For,</p>
               <p>1. If the body of the Act be to be interpreted by the title of the Act (as one would think it ſhould, the title repreſenting the deſign and main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Act, as the Contents of a Chapter does ſet out the chief things in the Chapter), Theſe men are not at all concerned in this Act. For it's Intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent and ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles:</hi> For they come not at any ſeditious Conventicles; they abhor ſuch Conventicles as much as theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> or any other men. For they know and teach ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, That ſedition is a work of the fleſh, which will exclude men from the Kingdom of God, as well as envyings and murthers, drunkenneſs and revellings, or other ſuch like ſins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. And if an <hi>Informer</hi> ſhall call an Aſſembly of men fearing God, who meet together for no other end but to pray to God, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, or Preach and Hear the Word of God, or other Religious exerciſes, a ſeditious Conventicle, he ſeemeth to me to be either an ignorant or malicious man.</p>
               <p>2. If the Law be to be interpreted by the Preface to the Act; neither will that concern the Meetings of theſe men. The Preface is this, <q>For providing further and more ſpeedy remedies againſt the growing and dangerous practiſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Sectaries, and other diſloyal perſons, who under pretence of tender Conſciences, have or may at their Meetings contrive inſurrections; as late experience hath ſhewn.</q> This Preface doth not in any of its branches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern theſe Miniſters called <hi>Non-conformiſts:</hi> They are not ſeditious Sectaries, for they are of the ſame Faith with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and Preach peace,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102521:26"/>and labour as much as in them lyes to live peaceably with all men. They are no diſloyal perſons, for they honour the King, and pray for him, both in their Cloſets, Families, and Aſſemblies. There are no dangerous practiſes at their Meetings; for when they meet together they pray to God, they read the Holy Scriptures, they preach ſound Doctrine, they praiſe God in ſinging Pſalms, they give Alms, theſe are no dangerous practiſes. They are none of thoſe, that at their Meetings contrive inſurrections, as experience ſhews: For no inſtance that I have heard of, hath been of any ſuch contrivance, for the long ſpace of time ſince they were caſt out of their livings, a good proof of their peaceableneſs; Beſides, they have Women and Children at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea, and perſons they know not, and that is not the manner of them that meet to contrive inſurrections. Some may ſay, though neither the Title nor the Preface do reach theſe men and their Meetings, yet the Act it ſelf doth; for it concerneth thoſe that ſhall be preſent at any Aſſembly or Conventicle, or Meeting, under colour or pretence of any exerciſe of Religion in other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than according to the Liturgy and practiſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> To which I anſwer, ſtill this relates to thoſe that are preſent at Religious exerciſes under a colour or pretence, and ſo it doth not reach them who meet together for no other end, but to worſhip God, and edifie their own Souls; but only reaches ſuch as uſe Religious exerciſes for a pretence and colour to carry on ſome evil deſigns, which cannot be proved againſt theſe men.</p>
               <p>But the moſt material paſſage in this Act which is made uſe of to ſuppreſs the Aſſemblies of theſe men, is this, <hi>It is pretended their exerciſes of Religion are in other manner than according to the Liturgy, and the practiſe of the Church of</hi> England. And therefore this muſt now be enquired into; which if theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> did rightly underſtand, and would put on charity, and did fear an oath, they would be very fearful to perſecute theſe men, or cauſe them to be fined and moleſted upon a pretence that their meeting is in other manner than according to the Liturgy, and the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Before I anſwer this, I would premiſe one paſſage out of Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylour,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Conner,</hi> about the interpretation of the Laws, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>It's obſervable that all Laws do inſinitely decline all barſh ſenſes, and are ambitious of gentle and benign interpretations.</hi> If this rule of interpreting Laws be granted, and practiſed, I doubt not but the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> and their Meetings will be exempted from the penalties of this Act.</p>
               <p>To clear this more particularly, Let it be conſidered, whether theſe mens prayings be in other manner than according to the Liturgy; to this end let me tell you in what manner theſe men pray, they pray to the Almighty God that made Heaven and Earth, who is the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. They pray to this God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and make uſe of no other Mediatour beſides our Lord Jeſus. They pray for things agreeable to the Will of God. They pray to God in a known tongue, which is underſtood by thoſe that joyn with them. They lift up their hearts, as well as their hands to God in the Heavens. The glory of God is that which they aim at in all their prayers. And are not all theſe things according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Doth not the Liturgy direct prayer to be made to the true God? Are not the Prayers of the Liturgy agreeable to the Will of God? Are not the Prayers of the Liturgy offered up to God in the Name of Chriſt, and in a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102521:27"/>known tongue, and for the glory of God? Did you find theſe men praying to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or any of the Gods of the Heathen: Did you hear them blaſpheme Jeſus Chriſt as the Jews do in their Synagogues: Did you find them praying in an unknown tongue; or praying to the Saints or Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do; or did you find them praying for unlawful things, you had ſome colour to inform againſt them as tranſgreſſors of this act. What is there then in theſe mens Prayers, that make you judg them to be in other manner than according to the Liturgy, which in your apprehenſion makes them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Law? It may be you will ſay, They do not uſe that form of Prayer which is preſcribed in the Liturgy, but they pray in other words. To which I anſwer, They may be truly ſaid to pray after the ſame manner, though they uſe not the ſame words: For, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave his Diſciples a form or pattern to direct them how to pray, and bid them pray after that manner that he had taught them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.9. <hi>After this manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray ye, Our Father which art in Heaven:</hi> And we find ſome of their Prayers recorded, as <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Act</hi> 4.23. Yet in neither of theſe, nor any other place, do we read that they uſed that form of Prayer which our Lord Jeſus taught them; but their Prayers were put up to God in other words. Now I would demand of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> Did the Apoſtles tranſgreſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Chriſt, and pray in other manner than Chriſt directed, when they uſed not that form of words which are contained in the Lords Prayers, but prayed in other words? I ſuppoſe they will be aſhamed to ſay the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tranſgreſſed the command, and prayed in other manner than he enjoin'd them. If they ſhould be ſo audacious as to charge the Apoſtles with the breach of Chriſt's command for praying in other words; they may be refuted from that gracious anſwer, which God gave to their Prayers, by filling them all with the Holy Ghoſt, after they had prayed to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31. If they will grant the Apoſtles did not pray in other manner than Chriſt directed, though they uſed other words, and ſo were no tranſgreſſors of Chriſt's command. Then I reply, Why then do theſe <hi>Informers</hi> perſecute, and perſecute theſe Miniſters as tranſgreſſors of this Act, pretending that in their Meetings they pray in other manner, than according to the Liturgy; when all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make a Prayer acceptable to God, is found in theſe mens Prayers, as well as in the Prayers in the Liturgy? Theſe mens Prayers are offered up to the ſame God, by the ſame Mediatour, by the help of the ſame Spirit; for things agreeable to the Will of God; and for the honour and glory of God, as well as the Prayers preſcribed in the Liturgy.</p>
               <p>But beſides what hath been ſaid already, there may be one thing more added, which will exempt theſe men from being guilty of exerciſing any Acts of Religion in other manner than according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that is this; The Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> includes all thoſe portions of the Holy Scripture, which are appointed to be read for the firſt and ſecond Leſion for the Morning and Evening Service throughout the whole year, together with what is read for the Epiſtles and Goſpels. And whatever Religious exerciſe is allowed of by theſe, by thoſe portions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appointed to be read by the Liturgy for the Morning or Evening Service; that Religious exerciſe is not performed in other manner than according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And if all thoſe portions of Scripture
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102521:27"/>be part of the Liturgy (which I ſuppoſe none will deny) it will be eaſie proving, that there is nothing done at theſe Aſſemblies, but what is agreeable to the Scriptures uſed in the Liturgy; I will touch but upon one or two places. On <hi>July</hi> the <hi>18th,</hi> for the ſecond Leſſon at the Evening Service is appointed to be read, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and there, praying in houſes, and in every other place is allowed of as well as in Temples, ſo it be done in an holy manner, <hi>v.</hi> 8, <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> And <hi>June</hi> the <hi>30th,</hi> for the ſecond Leſſon is appointed <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, and there the Apoſtle alloweth of all manner of Prayer, ſo it be in the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 18, <hi>Praying always with all Prayers, and Supplication in the Spirit:</hi> So that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Prayer at what time or place ſoever it be made, if it be Prayer in the Spirit, is allowed by the Scriptures appointed to be read by the Liturgy, and ſo is not in other manner than according to the Liturgy. Many more inſtances might be given to prove the Religious exerciſes of theſe men to be in ſuch manner as agreeth with the Scriptures preſcribed to be read by the Liturgy; but I ſhall add no more.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider whether theſe mens exerciſes of Religion be in other manner than according to the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If they had no benefit by the former clauſe (which as before explained, is for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though made uſe of to ſuppreſs them) yet they have protection from the penalty of the Law, as I conceive, by this clauſe, <hi>The practiſe of the Church of</hi> England. To clear this, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The beſt way to know this, is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> declared in the 39 Articles; and there the Church is thus defined, <hi>Art.</hi> 19, <q>The Viſible Church of Chriſt, is a Congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly adminiſtred according to Chriſt's Ordinance, and in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame.</q> And if this be a true deſcription of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (which they that own the Articles, I think ſhould not deny) then theſe <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For they are faithful men, men that believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (which I ſuppoſe is meant by faithful men); in their Congregations the Word of God is preached in truth and purity, the Sacraments are duly adminiſtred according to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame. If theſe <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> be not a part of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> How, and when, and by whom were they excommunicated and caſt out of the Church? If any ſay they do not comply with the Diſcipline and Ceremonies of the Church, I anſwer:</p>
               <p>1. In that definition which is given of the Church in the <hi>19th</hi> Article, there is nothing mentioned of the Diſcipline or Ceremonies: As Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> obſerves in his Expoſition of the 39 Articles, dedicated to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> His words are theſe, <hi>Some (and they, many of them very godly men) add Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline for a note of the Viſible Church; but becauſe the ſaid Diſcipline in part is included in the marks here mentioned; both we, and in effect, all well-ordered Churches, over-paſs it in this place, as no taken ſimply of the Viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is not founded upon the Ceremonies or the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but it is built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone: And upon this foundation do
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102521:28"/>theſe <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> Miniſters build as well as the Conformable Clergy; and therefore are of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as well as they. And if the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> be a conſiderable part of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> how can theſe <hi>Informers</hi> ſwear their Religious exerciſes are in other manner than according to the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>

               <p>If any man will put ſuch a harſh ſenſe upon theſe words, <hi>The practiſe of the Church of England,</hi> that he will have none underſtood but the conformable part of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Yet in this ſenſe it may be pleaded, It is not contrary to the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for men that have been brought up at the Univerſity, and after their examination of their fitneſs for the work of the Miniſtry, have been ordained, and ſet apart thereunto with faſting and Prayer, to preach ſound Doctrine, and before and after their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to pray to God in the name of his Son, for things agreeable to his Will; which is the practiſe of theſe men. But if it be ſaid it is the practiſe of the conformable Clergy in <hi>England</hi> to uſe the forms of Prayer preſcribed by the Liturgy, which theſe men do not; I anſwer, It is the practiſe of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to pray with other Prayers when in their Pulpits, both before and after Sermon, than what are preſcribed in the Liturgy; ſo that praying in other words, and in another method than what is preſcribed in the Liturgy, either before or after Sermon in Publick Aſſemblies, as the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> do, is not contrary to the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is praying and preaching without having the Liturgy read to the Aſſembly, contrary to the practiſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For at Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermons the reading of the Liturgy is often omitted. And it was the uſual practiſe at the chiefeſt Church in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and I ſuppoſe ſtill is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (where the Vice-Chancellor, Maſters, and Fellows of Colledges, and other Students aſſemble together) to have praying and preaching both in the forenoon and afternoon every Sabbath-day, without the uſe of the Liturgy in that Aſſembly. Alſo when there is <hi>Concio ad Clerum</hi> (which is frequent in Term time) there is praying to God, and preaching his Word without the uſe of the Liturgy. And yet I ſuppoſe no man will ſay, Theſe are none of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no crime to uſe different words, and different methods in preaching; ſo they that preach, do preach ſound Doctrine. And why ſhould it be eſteemed ſuch a great crime to uſe different forms and Methods in Prayer, provided that they that pray, pray to one and the ſame God, in the name of one and the ſame Mediator, for things agreeable to the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the <hi>Informers</hi> that plead they have Law for what they do, if this were a truth (which yet I will not grant them) I would adviſe them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how contrary their practiſe is to the Laws of God; I might name many inſtances, I will mention but two or three, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25.15, <hi>Lay not wait, Oh wicked man, againſt the dwelling of the righteous, ſpoil not his reſting-place.</hi> Iſa. 16.3, 4, <hi>Hide the out-caſt, bewray not him that wandreth. Let my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts dwell with thee Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the ſpoiler.</hi> If <hi>Moab</hi> who was a ſtranger to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was to ſhew that humanity towards the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when in a ſuffering condition, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray him that wandred; but to hide them, permit them to dwell in ſafety, to be a covert from the face of the ſpoiler: Then what ſhall we ſay to them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102521:28"/>that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and yet are ſo far from hiding and being a covert to the ſervants of God, that they lye in wait to betray them, and endeavour to ſpoil them of their goods? <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.12, <hi>Let none of you imagine evil in your heart againſt his neighbour, and love no falſe oath; for all theſe are things that I hate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> When you are contriving how you may do evil to theſe men; you are doing that which the Lord hates. The greatneſs of your ſin, and your contrariety to the Word of God, hath been ſo fully ſet out in the former Chapter, that I ſhall need to add no more on this head: only I ſhall mention this, The Laws by which we ſhall all be judged at the laſt day, are the Laws of God; and therefore we ſhould do nothing here, but what we can give a good account of at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.12, <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do ye, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty.</hi>

                  <hi>Plea</hi> 6. If theſe men would preach and meet in Churches, we would not moleſt them; but we hate this meeting in houſes and barns, and ſuch like places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. But why ſhould you be ſo much offended at preaching in houſes, and other retired places, when as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached not only in the Temple and the Synagogues, but in private houſes, and ſhips, and other places, where the people could come conveniently to hear them. Jeſus Chriſt preached in an houſe, when there was as many as the houſe could hold, even to the very doors, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>It was noiſed that he was in the houſe. And ſtraight-way many were gathered together, inſomuch as there was no room to receive them;</hi> no, not ſo much as about the door; <hi>and he preached the word unto them.</hi> He preached out of a ſhip, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.3, <hi>He entred into one of the ſhips which was Simons, and prayed him that he would thruſt out a little from the Land, and be ſate down, and taught the people out of the ſhip.</hi> He preached ſometime upon the mountains, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.1, 2, <hi>And ſeeing the multitudes, he got up into a mountain, and when be was ſet, his Diſciples came unto him, and he opened his mouth and taught them.</hi> He did not decline preaching in any place where he had an opportunity to diſpenſe the Word. And as Jeſus Chriſt, ſo alſo his Diſciples preached in houſes, as well as in the Temple, and in the Synagogues, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.42, <hi>And daily in the Temple and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and to preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Act. 20.20, <hi>I kept back nothing from you, but have ſhewed you and have taught you publickly, and from houſe to houſe.</hi> For the ſpace of two years <hi>Paul</hi> preached in his own houſe, and received all that came to him, and no man forbade him. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.30, 31, <hi>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired houſe, and received all that came unto him, preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching thoſe things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Meetings and Preachings were very private, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Could theſe men enjoy publick places to preach in they would chooſe them rather than private houſes; not that they place any holineſs in them, or think the worſhip of God more acceptable in one place, than in another; but becauſe of the conveniency of them. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24, <hi>God that made the world and all things therein, ſeeing he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</hi> It's the worſhip and worſhipper that God looks at, more than the place where the worſhip is performed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21, 23. It ſeems irrational and not candid (to ſay no worſe) to ſhut theſe men out of the Churches, and then to reproach them and perſecute them, becauſe they preach not in Churches, but in private houſes and barns, and where they beſt can.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102521:29"/>
               <p n="3">3. A ſtable is a more contemptible place than a dwelling-houſe, or barn; yet becauſe there was no room in the Inn, our Lord Jeſus was born in a ſtable, and laid in a manger after he was put into his ſwadling-cloths, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. <hi>She brought forth her firſt-born Son, and wrapped him in ſwadling-cloths, and laid him in a manger, becauſe there was no room for them in the Inn.</hi> And ſhall we think any place too mean for us to aſſemble together in, ſeeing our Lord Jeſus humbled himſelf ſo far as to be born in a ſtable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 7. We cannot believe it is ſuch a great ſin as you have ſaid, to moleſt and perſecute theſe men; for if it were, we ſhould be greatly troubled in our Conſcience, and ſhould have no quiet in our minds night nor day; but we are under no trouble of Conſcience for what we do; and therefore we think we do not ſin in moleſting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. A man may be a great ſinner, and yet have no trouble in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for his ſins; yea, it may be a hard matter to convince him of his ſins. Whoredom is a great ſin; <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judg:</hi> Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of ſome that live in this ſin, and ſay they have done no iniquity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Such is the way of an adulterous woman, ſhe eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I have done no wickedneſs.</hi> Oppreſſion and Murther are grievous ſins, yet ſome men have ſuch ſeared Conſciences, that they are no more troubled at theſe ſins, than if they were innocent perſons. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.4, 5, <hi>Feed the flock of the Slaughter, whoſe poſſeſſors ſlay them, and hold themſelves not guilty; and they that ſell them ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord, I am rich.</hi> Jer. 2.34, 35, <hi>Alſo in thy skirts is found the blood of the ſouls of the poor innocents, I have not found it upon ſecret ſearch, but upon all theſe, yet thou ſayſt, becauſe I am innocent, ſurely hss anger ſhall turn from me.</hi> To kill the Diſciples of Chriſt is an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſin; yet ſome are under ſuch a ſpirit of deluſion, that inſtead of acknowledging their ſin, they think they do God good Service. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2, <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea, the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been already proved by many Arguments out of the Word of God, that this practiſe of yours is exceeding ſinful, and abominable in the ſight of God, and therefore if you have no terrours of Conſcience for what you have done, it is becauſe your hearts are ſo hardened that you are grown paſt feeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 8. But if our perſecuting theſe men were ſo great a ſin, ſurely God would ſend ſome great Judgment upon us; either fire would fall from Heaven and conſume us, or the earth would open its mouth, and ſwallow us up, or ſome other ſtrange puniſhment would befall us; but God lets us alone, and we thrive and proſper in the world, and therefore we can't think this is ſuch a great ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. God oft-times lets great ſinners alone, and doth not puniſh them for their ſins in this world; becauſe he reſerveth them to be puniſhed at the day of Judgment. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of Judgment to be puniſhed. Job</hi> obſerved in his time, that there were perſons that did remove the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and violently took away the flocks, and fed thereon, oppreſſed the Widow and the Fatherleſs, and grind the face of the poor, and committed other abominable ſins, and yet God did not puniſh them for their ſins, <hi>Job</hi> 24.2, to the 12. <hi>Some remove the Land-mark, and violently take away flocks,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102521:29"/>and feed thereon. They drive away the aſs of the fatherleſs, and take the widows exe for a pledge, and yet God layeth not folly to them.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> obſerved of many in his time, that were great oppreſſers and afflicters of Gods people, and yet they proſpered, and did not meet with troubles, either in life or death, as other men did; but had even what heart could wiſh, though they were ungodly ſinners, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. from <hi>v.</hi> 3. to the <hi>12th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Glory not in this, that God lets you alone in your ſinful ways, and ſuffers you to proſper; For it's a token that he intends to deſtroy you for ever, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 97.2, <hi>When the wicked do ſpring as the graſs, and when all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be the hand of the Lord is lifted up, and hath gone out againſt you ſeveral ways, ſince you took up this practiſe of <hi>Informing;</hi> though you take no notice of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11, <hi>Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies ſhall devour them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Though you do not meet with judgments in your Bodies, Eſtate, or Families; yet it may be God hath ſmitten you with ſpiritual judgments. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and would not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go to worſhip God; beſides the Plagues that reach the outward man, God ſent Plagues upon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.14, <hi>I will at this time ſend all my Plagues upon thy heart.</hi> And how did God ſend all his Plagues upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart? It was by giving him up to Judicial hardneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.1, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Go unto Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart.</hi> It's a grievous curſe to be given up of God to obſtinacy of heart, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.65. <hi>Give them ſorrow of heart:</hi> (or as it is in the Margin) <hi>obſtinacy of heart, thy curſe unto them.</hi> So <hi>Vatablus,</hi> give them <hi>obſtinatum cor,</hi> an obſtinate heart. When God gives a man an obſtinate heart, he gives him a dreadful curſe; what ſadder token of God's diſpleaſure, than when God lets him alone in his ſins, as he did <hi>Ephraim?</hi> Hoſ. 4.17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Hoſ. 12.14, <hi>Ephraim provoked him to anger moſt bitterly.</hi> Whence I infer, God is provoked to anger moſt bitterly with thoſe ſinners whom he lets alone, and ſuffers to go on in their ſins without rebuke; <hi>For whom he loves, he rebukes and chaſtens,</hi> Rev. 3.19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though God out of his patience bear with you, and give you time and ſpace to repent; yet if you repent not, ſudden and unavoidable deſtruction will come upon you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1, <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy. Job</hi> ſpeaking of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors (and I conceive <hi>Informers</hi> to be guilty of oppreſſion) tells us, how oft-times God takes them away in a very ſudden and terrible manner, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.20, 21, 22, <hi>Terrours take hold of him as waters, a tempeſt ſtealeth him in the night, the eaſt-wind carrieth him away, and he departeth, and as a ſtorm burleth him out of his place. For God ſhall caſt upon him and not ſpare; he would fain flee out of his hand.</hi> All this time that God beareth with you, and waits for your repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he is whetting his ſword and bending his bow, and preparing for you the inſtruments of death; and the longer the ſword is whetting, the ſharper it will be, and give the more deadly wound when it ſtrikes you, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 7.10, 11, 12, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day, if he turn not, he will whet his ſword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready, he hath alſo prepared for him the inſtruments of death, he ordaineth his arrows againſt his perſecutors:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If the work you went about were ſo good, yet it is ſordid and ſinful to go about ſuch an employment from a covetous principle. Teaching the Word of God is a good work, and judging the cauſes between man and man is a good work; yet when a man's great end in theſe works is to get Money, they become ſinful, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.8.11, <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord to declare unto Jacob his tranſgreſſion, and Iſrael his ſin. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Judas</hi> gained thirty pieces of ſilver by betraying of Chriſt, but what good did his Money do him? when his Conſcience was awakened and made ſenſible of his ſin, his Money was a trouble to him, he was weary of it, and threw it away, and hanged himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.5, <hi>He caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the temple, and departed and hanged himſelf.</hi> When <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Balack</hi> to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had a great reward proffered him, the love of the wages of unrighteouſneſs prevailed with him to go; but what befel him in the way? An Angel met him with a drawn ſword, and would have ſlain him, had not the Aſs turned out of the way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.32, 33. And God to ſhew to <hi>Balaam</hi> his folly and madneſs, gave the Aſs a voice to rebuke him. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15, 16, <hi>which have forſaken the right way and gone aſtray, following the way of Balaam the Son of Bozor, who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs; but was rebuked for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The dumb Aſs ſpeaking with mans voice, ſorbade the madneſs of the Prophet.</hi> They that out of love to the wages of unrighteouſneſs, will curſe the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, are little better than mad-men. The very beaſts, had they power to ſpeak, would cry out of, and rebuke the iniquity of theſe men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this practiſe of yours be ſo ſinful as hath been proved, then what you gain in this kind, is got with the loſs of your Souls; and if you could gain the whole world, and ſhould loſe your ſouls, you would be miſerable for ever, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world and loſe his own Soul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider what the Scripture ſaith of unrighteous men, and the gain they make by their unrighteous practiſes. And I leave it to your Conſcience to judge, whether to get riches by cauſing men to be puniſhed for praying to God, and hearing his Word, be not to get them unrighteouſly.</p>
               <p>1. All that is gained unrighteouſly, is got with the loſs of the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, <hi>Know you not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. All that is gotten unrighteouſly, will laſt but a little while, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11, <hi>He that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and in the end ſhall be a ſool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The riches you get this way, will eat your fleſh as it were fire, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of theſe things in the other world will torment your Conſcience, as much as fire does your fleſh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire, ye have heaped up treaſure againſt the laſt days. Behold, the bire of the labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud cryeth,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102521:30"/>and the crys of them that reaped are entred into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> If the hire of a labouring man kept back by fraud cryeth, and the cry entereth into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth; how much more do the eſtates of thoſe Miniſters who have been Labourers in God's vineyard, which have been by you taken away by force and violence, cry unto the Lord, and their crys enter into the ears of the Lord of Hoſts? And if the ruſt of the eſtates of covetous men, who heap up Money and do no good with it, will be a witneſs againſt them, and will eat their fleſh like fire, then what a witneſs will all thoſe goods be againſt you at the day of Judgment, which you have cauſed to be taken away from the ſervants of God? and how will the remembrance thereof vex and torment your Conſciences; even as if your fleſh were continually burning in the fire?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 10. We abhor thoſe men that turn <hi>Informers</hi> for filthy lucre ſake, and look upon them as vile perſons: It is zeal for the glory of God, and the good of the Church, that makes us proſecute theſe men: I purpoſe to give my part of the fines to the poor, and to charitable uſes; therefore I hope I am praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>

When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made havock of the Church of Chriſt, and haled the members of it to Priſon, he did not act for gain or preferment, but out of zeal; yet he acknowledgeth himſelf a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor and injurious, though what he did proceeded out of a blind zeal, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, <hi>Concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church,</hi> Act. 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though he did nothing againſt the members of Chriſt, but what he thought to be his duty; yet when he was better inſtructed, he called himſelf the chief of ſinners, for perſecuting of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An indiſcreet zeal may carry a man out, not only to do that which is prejudicial to himſelf, but may bring Judgments upon the Kingdom where he lives. <hi>Saul</hi> ſlaying the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> out of zeal to the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> brought a famine, which is a ſore Judgment, that continued a long time in the Land even three years, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2, <hi>Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year. And David enquired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered, it is for Saul and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Iſrael, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Iſrael had ſworn unto them. And Saul ſought to ſlay them in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah.)</hi>

                  <hi>Plea</hi> 11. We hate theſe men, and know not how to find an occaſion againſt them; except it be in the matters of their God, and this is a ready way to be avenged of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If you hate theſe men, then you are Murtherers in God's account, and ſhall have no part in his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever hateth his brother is a murtherer, and ye know, that no murtherer, hath eternal life abiding in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though men cannot ſee the ſpite that is in your hearts, but it may be covered over with fair pretences; yet God ſeeth it, and he will requite it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Thou haſt ſeen it; For thou beholdeſt miſchief and ſpite to requite it with thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe any that come to theſe Meetings have done you wrong, yet you ought not to avenge your ſelves; but to overcome evil with good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19, 21, <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord. Be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of evil; but overcome evil with good. Much leſs ſhould you for the offence of one man ſeek to be revenged of an Aſſembly of men.</hi> As <hi>Haman,</hi> when he had taken offence at <hi>Mordecai,</hi> ſought to be avenged of the whole race of the Jews, which proved his overthrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 12. We think, may others ſay, that ſome of theſe men are righteous perſons, and mean well; but they diſturb the peace of the Church, and their preaching cauſeth diviſion in the Church; for by their means are Families divided, and ſome go one way and ſome another. And this makes us labour to ſuppreſs them; becauſe the good of the Church is to be preferred above the good of particular perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If you grant theſe men to be righteous men, you had need take heed how you perſecute them. What <hi>Job</hi> ſaid to his friends, <hi>Job</hi> 19.28, <hi>But ye ſhould ſay, why perſecute we him, ſeeing the root of the matter is in him?</hi> That you ſhould ſay, why perſecute we theſe men, ſeeing the root of the matter is in them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are of the ſame faith with us, and walk in the fear of God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by the Church you underſtand the body of Chriſtians, who embrace the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and walk in all the Ordinances and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord Jeſus; then theſe men are a great part of the Church, and are not the diſturbers of the Churches peace: For whom do they moleſt, whom do they perſecute? They are deſirous to live at peace among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to have peace with all men, as much as in them is. Theſe <hi>Informers</hi> and their adherents are the diſturbers of the Churches peace, who perſecute men profeſſing Faith in Chriſt, and walking in all the Ordinances of the Goſpel; for worſhipping God. If by the Church you mean the Paſtors and Teachers of the Church; theſe men do not moleſt the conformable Clergy, in their executing their Miniſterial office. As for ſuch of them as are ſound in the Faith, holy in their Lives, faithful Preachers of God's holy Word; They ſay, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102521:31"/>Bleſſing of the Lord be upon them, and rejoyce to hear when they convert Souls to Chriſt. And in this ſenſe alſo <hi>Informers</hi> are the diſturbers of the Church, for their great deſign is to moleſt and perſecute the Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> rather than any other perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great diviſions aroſe in the Jewiſh Church upon the preaching of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Families were divided upon his preaching, ſome were for him, others were againſt him. Fathers againſt their children, and children againſt their fathers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.51, 52, 53. <hi>Suppoſe you that I am come to give peace on earth; I tell you nay, but rather diviſion. For from henceforth there ſhall be five in one houſe divided, three againſt two, and two againſt three. The Father ſhall be divided againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father. The Mother againſt the Daughter, and the Daughter againſt her Mother. The Mother-in-law againſt the Daughter-in-law, and the Daughter-in-Law againſt the Mother-in-law.</hi> Was Jeſus Chriſt to be ſuppreſſed? was his preaching to be blamed, becauſe of theſe diviſions that followed upon it? Far be it from any man to ſay or think ſo. In like manner, if diviſions and diſtentions ariſe in Families, and among Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations upon the preaching of the Miniſters of Chriſt; neither they are to be ſuppreſſed, nor their Miniſters to be blamed.</p>
               <p>Yea, it may be further added, that the preaching of the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> Miniſters alſo doth cauſe diſſentions and diviſions in Families and Pariſhes; when many Families in one Pariſh will repair to hear the Miniſters of another Pariſh, and that in great numbers; ſo that ſome Congregations where Miniſters are eminent, are thronged; others, ſcarce any hearers at all; yea, in the ſame Families in <hi>London,</hi> and other places: ſeveral in the ſame Family do repair to ſeveral conforming Miniſters of other Pariſhes. And ſome Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty zealous too for Uniformity, do conſtantly deſert their own Miniſters to hear ſome other they better approve of, taking all or the greateſt part of their Families with them, and for years together; yet I ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Informers</hi> judg not themſelves obliged out of their love of the Churches peace to proſecute theſe Miniſters and their hearers, the one for preaching, and the other hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plea</hi> 13. We are convinced we have done evil, but you ſhould not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved us ſo openly whereby we are made odious in the eyes of the people. We were ſufficiently hated before, but now we are like to be much more hated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> You have ſinned openly, and therefore you are to be rebuked openly, that others might hear and fear, and not follow your evil example, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10, <hi>Them that ſin rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Open rebuke is better than ſecret love,</hi> Prov. 27.5, And you are not offended with a man for loving of you, though it be with a ſecret love. Why then ſhould you be offended for being openly rebuked?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have named no mans perſon. I have only laid open the odious nature of your ſin. And your ſin is more odious than can be expreſſed. I would not have any man hate your perſons; but I would have all men hate your ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you had died in your ſins, you ſhould have been put to everlaſting ſhame, for that will be the portion of impenitent ſinners, to be put to ſhame and contempt for ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2, <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to everlaſting ſhame and contempt.</hi> But if by this, or any other means, you are brought to repentance, then ſhall you have everlaſting glory.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Inferences from the foregoing Diſcourſe.</head>
               <p>I Shall now draw ſome Inferences from what hath been ſaid concerning the greatneſs of the ſin of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> that perſecute righteous men for praying to God, and preaching and hearing his holy Word, and cauſe their Aſſemblies to be broken up, and their goods to be taken from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. If this be ſuch a great ſin, then let thoſe that have been guilty of it, repent and make reſtitution. Without repentance there's no poſſibility that you ſhould avoid periſhing for ever, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3, <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Conſider how ſharply the Lord Jeſus reproved the Phariſees, hindring mens entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.13.33, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of heaven againſt men; for you neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in. Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers: How can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> The Phariſees were ſaid to ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven; becauſe they hindred the preaching of the Goſpel, which is called, The Goſpel of the Kingdom, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.14. And the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.47. Becauſe it is the way and means of bringing men into the Kingdom. That the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven, by hindring the preaching the Goſpel, is evident from <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.52. where the ſhutting up the Kingdom is called the taking away the key of knowledg. They acted the part of Serpents and Vipers; they did bite and ſting thoſe that preached, and thoſe that heard the Goſpel, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.22. and ſo hindred mens entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. And for this Serpentine carriage, Jeſus tells them they were in danger of eternal damnation. <hi>How can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> will ye do the ſame things the Phariſees did, and yet think ye ſhall not fall into the ſame condemnation? your only way to avoid it is, by timely and ſincere repentance. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, and ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as you muſt leave off your ſins, ſo if you expect mercy from God; you muſt make reſtitution to thoſe perſons, from whom you have taken or cauſed to be taken away any of their goods. To convince you of the neceſſity of making reſtitution; conſider ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.15. <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again that he hath robbed, walk in the ſtatutes of life; he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</hi> It's not ſufficient that the wicked leave off robbing; but he muſt give again that which he hath robbed, to thoſe from whom it was robbed; if he would enter into life and not dye in his ſins. It may be you will ſay, We are not thieves and robbers, and ſo are not obliged by this Scripture to make reſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Hebrew word <hi>Gazal,</hi> ſignifieth any violent wreſting, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing mens right out of their hands. And it is ſo rendred of things taken away violently, when a man ſeeth or knoweth it, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.31. <hi>Job</hi> 20.19.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102521:32"/>
               <p n="2">2. Reſtitution is to be made for all acts of deceit, as well as ſecret theft, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2, 4, <hi>If a ſoul ſin, and commit a treſpaſs agaimſt the Lord, in a thing taken by violence, and hath deceived his neighbour.—Then it ſhall be, becauſe he hath ſinned, and is guilty;</hi> that he ſhall reſtore what he hath violently taken away; or the thing he hath deceitfully gotten.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſome reſpects you are worſe than thieves and robbers; For,</p>
               <p>1. Thieves are aſhamed when they are diſcovered, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.26, <hi>The thief is aſhamed, when he is found.</hi> But 'tis not ſo with you.</p>
               <p>2. The thief uſually takes the dead time of the night, but you commit your ſin at mid-day. The more impudency there is in any ſin, the greater it is.</p>
               <p>3. The thief doth not rob men for their Religion; but you take away mens goods for ſerving God, ſee the neceſſity of reſtitution from other Scriptures. <hi>Zophar</hi> tells us that oppreſſors, and ſuch as take away others goods, muſt make reſtitution, or elſe they ſhall never enjoy peace in their Conſciences, <hi>Job</hi> 20.18, 19, 20. <hi>According to his ſubſtance ſhall the reſtitution be, and he ſhall not rejoyce therein; becauſe he hath oppreſſed and forſaken the poor, becauſe he hath violently taken away an houſe which he hath not builded, ſurely he ſhall not feel quietneſs in his belly. Zacheus</hi> when he was converted, made reſtitution to all perſons he had wronged by falſe accuſation; for all wrongs he had done them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8, <hi>If I have taken any thing from any man, by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi> Hear what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith on this place: <hi>Quatenus fieri poteſt, reſarcienda ſunt damna aliis per vim aut dolum illata; quod ipſa natura dictat: ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> enim peccare deſiſtit, qui alienum retinet.</hi> As far as a man is able, all the wrongs he hath done to other men, either by fraud or violence muſt be reſtored and made up, for the light of nature teacheth a man ſo to do, neither doth he deſiſt from his ſin, that doth not make reſtitution. It concerns you to conſider whether you have not wronged theſe men by falſe accuſation, when you accuſed them to the Magiſtrates for keeping ſeditious Meetings, and thereby getting their goods diſtrained; if you have, this example of <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſhould provoke you to reſtore and make up all the wrongs they have ſuſtained by your falſe accuſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſ.</hi> 2. Let all men take heed of being partakers with theſe <hi>Informers</hi> in their great ſin. For ſuch as partake with them in their ſin, ſhall alſo be partakers of thoſe Plagues, which God will ſend upon them for their ſins; and they are very dreadful, which without repentance will be their portion; as hath been ſhewn in the ſecond Chapter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Come out of her my people, that you be not partakers of her ſins, and that you receive not of her plagues.</hi> As they that partake of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s ſins, ſhall be partakers of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Plagues; ſo ſhall they that partake of the <hi>Informers</hi> ſins, partake of the <hi>Informers</hi> Plagues, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.24. <hi>Whoſo is partner with a thief hateth his own ſoul.</hi> The ſame I may ſay of him that is partner with theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> he hateth his own Soul. And why doth he that is a partner with a thief hate his ſoul? Becauſe he takes a ſure and ſpeedy courſe to deſtroy his own Soul. Let me here ſhew you, how many ways a man may be partaker with theſe <hi>Informers</hi> in their ſin; for theſe men do involve many others in the guilt of their hainous tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>1. They that harbour theſe men in their houſes, and wiſh them good ſucceſs in their undertakings, are partners with them in their evil deeds, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>Ep. v.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him, God ſpeed; For he that biddeth him God ſpeed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102521:33"/>is partaker of his evil deeds.</hi> As he that harboureth, and encourageth falſe teachers, is partaker with them in their evil-deeds; ſo alſo they that receive into their houſes, encourage and wiſh ſucceſs to theſe men that oppoſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, that teach the Word of God in truth, are partakers with them in their evil deeds.</p>
               <p>2. They become partakers with them in their ſin, who rejoyce and take pleaſure and delight to ſee theſe <hi>Informers</hi> diſturb the Meetings of theſe men, <hi>Obad.</hi> v. 12, <hi>But thou ſhouldſt not have looked upon the day of thy brother, in the day that he became a ſtranger; neither ſhould thou have rejoyced over the children of Judah, in the day of their deſtruction, neither ſhouldſt thou have ſpoken proudly in the day of their diſtreſs.</hi> They that take pleaſure in others wickedneſs, are under the ſame, or rather a greater guilt than thoſe perſons that commit the wickedneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32, <hi>Who knowing the Judgment of God, that they that do ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but take pleaſure in them that do them. Hoc pejus illo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place. This latter, To take pleaſure in them that do them, is worſe than the former; for a man may do evil under a temptation, but to take pleaſure in another man's ſin, argues an exceeding great corruption in that man's heart. God was greatly offended with <hi>Moab,</hi> for rejoycing at the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſpoiling the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Jer. 48.26, 27. <hi>Moab alſo ſhall ſwallow in his vomit, and he alſo ſhall be in deriſion. For was not Iſrael a deriſion unto thee? was he found among thieves? For ſince thou ſpeakeſt of him, thou skippedſt for joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Such as at the inſtigation of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> take away or buy thoſe Goods which are taken away from men fearing God, for their worſhipping God, and that either becauſe they are ſold at a low rate, or becauſe they would not have the <hi>Informers</hi> go without a reward, <hi>Obad.</hi> 13. <hi>Thou ſhouldſt not have entred into the gate of my people, in the day of their calamity; yea, thou ſhouldſt not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their ſubſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Such as plead their cauſe, defend and juſtifie them in their evil ways, they are deeply guilty, and partakers with them in all the evil and miſchief that they do. It is worſe to plead for ſin than to commit it. As <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Nam affectu abreptus peccat aliquis, ſine eo non peccaturus. At qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendunt talia &amp; docent vitio carere, ſane gravius delinquunt. Joaſh</hi> thought that man worthy to dye that ſhould plead for ſin, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.31, <hi>Will ye plead for Baal, will you ſave him? He that will plead for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning:</hi> To juſtifie a wicked man, is an abominable ſin in the ſight of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15, <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. They that afford their aid, help and aſſiſtance to theſe men, in their evil deſigns, are partakers of their ſin. To help an ungodly man in an evil under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, will bring down wrath from the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2, <hi>Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord; Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made confeſſion of his ſin of perſecution, he mentions the keeping the clothes of them that ſtoned <hi>Stephen,</hi> as an evidence of his conſent to that wicked fact, and his being involved in the guilt of his blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.20, <hi>And when the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was ſhed, I was ſtanding by, and conſenting to his death, and kept the rayment of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102521:33"/>them that ſlew him. Paul</hi> did not help to throw the ſtones, he did but keep the rayment of thoſe perſons, that ſtoned him, and this little aſſiſtance that he gave them was a great trouble to his Conſcience. Take heed therefore of giving any aſſiſtance to theſe men, either by guiding them to the places, where theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are aſſembled, that they ſeek after; It is recorded to <hi>Judas</hi> eternal infamy, <hi>That he was guide to them that took Jeſus, Act.</hi> 1.16. or by telling them the names of the perſons, whom they find aſſembled together, or drawing up their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations they give unto the Magiſtrate, or aiding them in the diſperſing theſe Aſſemblies, or any other way helping them in their evil way.</p>
               <p>6. Such as excite, counſel, and put forward theſe <hi>Informers</hi> to undertake their evil work, are partakers with them in their ſin. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſaid to make the calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> made; becauſe he made it by their inſtigation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.2.35. <hi>The people gathered themſelves together unto Aaron; and ſaid unto him, up, make us Gods, which ſhall go before us. And the Lord plagued the people, becauſe they made the calf which Aaron made.</hi> The guilt was equally, and the plague greater upon the people for ſtirring up <hi>Aaron</hi> to make the calf, than upon <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf, that made the golden calf. <hi>David</hi> is charged with killing <hi>Uriah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9, <hi>Thou haſt killed Uriah the Hittite with the ſword;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> himſelf did not touch him, they were the <hi>Ammonites</hi> that killed him; but becauſe <hi>David</hi> plotted and contrived his death, and wrote Letters to <hi>Joab,</hi> to ſet him in the forefront of the battel where he was ſlain, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11.14, 15. <hi>Uriah</hi>'s blood was laid to <hi>David</hi>'s charge. <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſtirring up <hi>Ahab</hi> to work wickedneſs, made her a partaker of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s guilt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25, <hi>There was none like unto Ahab that did ſell himſelf to work wickedneſs in the ſight of the Lord whom Jezabel his wife ſtirred up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Such as hire thoſe <hi>Informers</hi> to undertake this work, or give them a reward for what they do, are partakers of their evil deeds. As the adverſaries of the Jews hired men to hinder the building of the temple, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4.5, <hi>They hired coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers againſt them to fruſtrate their purpoſe all the days of Cyrus.</hi> So ſome men that are adverſaries to theſe Meetings, and are aſhamed to appear in this odious work themſelves, do hire men fit for their turn to carry on this evil deſign. Let ſuch perſons remember what a mark of diſpleaſure the Lord left upon the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> for hiring <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Not only the men of that generation, but their poſterity was excluded for ever from coming into the Congregation of the Lord for this ſin, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.1, 2, <hi>On that day they read in the book of Moſes in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and Moabite ſhould not come into the congregation of God for ever. Becauſe they met not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he ſhould curſe them. Howbeit God turned the curſe into a bleſſing.</hi> All that clenſe their hearts from ſin, and walk according to the rule of the Word, are as dear to God, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were of old; yea, they are God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſ. 73.1. <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> Gal. 6.16, <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> And if God were ſo angry with the <hi>Moabites</hi> for hiring <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he would not ſuffer them to come into the Congregation of the Lord for ever; Then how much more will God's anger be kindled againſt thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and yet hire vain perſons to perſecute ſuch as are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for worſhipping and ſerving the Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 3. Are theſe <hi>Informers</hi> guilty of ſuch a great ſin, then let me adviſe ſuch as are, or hereafter may be tempted to turn <hi>Informers,</hi> in the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:102521:34"/>Prov. 1.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>My Son, if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not. If they ſay, come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cauſe. We ſhall find all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoil.

They that are helpers in an evil work are involved in guilt, and will receive puniſhment from the hands of the Lord, as well as the chief agents. But ſome may ſay, Theſe <hi>Informers</hi> threaten to bring us into trouble, if we will not go along with them, and help to break and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the Aſſemblies of theſe men: it is not love to them or the work they do, that makes us go along with them; for it is againſt our Conſcience to moleſt theſe men, either in or for their worſhipping of God; but we do it that we may not come into trouble.</p>
               <p>

See how far you are from <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpirit, he choſe affliction rather than the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> But you chooſe the drudgery of ſin, rather than to run the hazard of a light affliction.</p>

As thoſe <hi>Informers</hi> threaten to bring you into trouble, if you joyn not with them in their evil deſigns; ſo God does threaten wo and wrath to them that ſpoil thoſe that did not ſpoil them, and deal treacherouſly with thoſe that dealt not treacherouſly with them, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33.1, <hi>Wo to thee, that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled, and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee.</hi> What hurt did theſe men do to you, that you ſhould aſſiſt them that would ſpoil their goods; and their opportunities of ſerving God? whoſe threatnings are to be dreaded moſt, the threatnings of God or of Men?</p>

               <p>2. God is to be feared more than all the men in the world; for there is no man can do ſuch things as God can do unto us. The worſt that man can do, is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102521:35"/>to kill the body; but God can caſt both body and ſoul into hell-fire, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>I ſay unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you, whom you ſhall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell, yea, I ſay unto you, Fear him.</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But theſe men bring Warrants with them from the Magiſtrates, which require us to go along with them, elſe we would not attend ſuch vile perſons as many of theſe are; but when we have a Warrant from the Magiſtrates to go with them, we muſt be obedient to authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is your duty to obey your Superiours in all their lawful commands; If your Warrants contain nothing in them, but what is warranted by the Word of God, you ought to do what is enjoyned you therein. But if they contain any thing contrary to the mind and Will of God, in that caſe you are to obey God rather than man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Informers</hi> procure Warrants from the Magiſtrates to give your aſſiſtance to them, under pretence that there is a ſeditious Meeting; believe not their reports: For many of them are falſe accuſers; but ſee with your own eyes, and hear with your own ears, what is ſaid and done in their Aſſemblies, which they call ſeditious, before you create any diſturbance to them. And it may be you will be convinced, that God is in the midſt of them of a truth; and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which the <hi>Informers</hi> raiſe up of theſe men and their Meetings, are falſe and ſlanderous reports. When the Phariſees ſent Officers to apprehend Chriſt upon the ſtrange rumours that were ſpread abroad concerning him, in ſtead of diſturbing and bringing him to the Rulers, they went away and extolled his preaching, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.32, 45, 46. <hi>The Phariſees heard that the people murmured ſuch things concerning him, and the Phariſees and chief Prieſts ſent officers to take him.—Then came the officers to the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, and they ſaid unto them, why have ye not brought him? The officers anſwered, never man ſpake like unto this man.</hi> When you are ſent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb theſe men, did you attend with humble hearts, while they are praying to God, and preaching his holy Word? I doubt not but you would be convinced in your Conſciences, that there is nothing ſaid or done at theſe Meetings that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth puniſhment, and that you ought not to offer any violence to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you find any perſon under a pretence of Religious exerciſes contriving inſurrections, or if you hear them ſtirring up the people to ſedition, you may make uſe of your power to ſuppreſs ſedition and inſurrections. I plead nothing for ſuch kind of men; but abhor and declare againſt their practiſes, who uſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes as a pretence to carry on ſedition and inſurrections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When you go to the Aſſemblies of theſe men; if you find them aſſembled together in a peaceable manner; if you ſee and hear nothing but praying to God in the name of Chriſt, for things agreeable to the Will of God; and preaching the Goſpel, whereby men may be ſaved; if you hear nothing contrary to ſound Doctrine; If you ſee nothing inconſiſtent with godlineſs; inſtead of moleſting theſe men, or cauſing them to be puniſhed, you ſhould do well to carry the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> before the Magiſtrates, and acquaint them, that in obedience to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you have been ſearching for ſeditious Meetings, but could find none; that thoſe men, whom theſe <hi>Informers</hi> pretend were met in a ſeditious manner;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102521:35"/>you found met in a peaceable manner, and that they were doing nothing elſe, but praying to God in the name of Chriſt, and preaching and hearing God's holy Word; and that you think you ſhould ſin againſt God if you ſhould diſturb or puniſh men for worſhipping and ſerving God, under a pretence of ſuppreſſing of ſeditious Conventicles; and that in your judgment the <hi>Informers</hi> ought to be puniſhed as falſe accuſers; rather than theſe men for ſerving God. Under the Law, when one man was a witneſs againſt another, and teſtified that which was wrong, diligent inquiſition was to be made, and if the witneſs had teſtified that which was falſe, the Magiſtrates were to puniſh the falſe witneſs, and not the party againſt whom he had teſtified falſe things, and his puniſhment was to be according to what he had intended to have done againſt his brother, againſt whom he was a falſe witneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.16, 18, 19, <hi>If a falſe witneſs riſe up againſt any man to teſtifie againſt him that which was wrong; The judge ſhall make diligent inquiſition: And behold if the witneſs be a falſe witneſs, and hath teſtified falſly againſt his brother, Then ſhalt thou do unto him, as he thought to do unto his brother; ſo ſhalt thou put evil away from among you.</hi> Reſpect to the command of God ſhould keep Magiſtrates from being too ſudden in crediting and acting upon the teſtimony of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> till according to God's appointment, they have made diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, whether there be truth in what they have teſtified; and if they find them falſe witneſſes they ſhould execute the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt them; and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>1. The equity and righteouſneſs of the Law.</p>
               <p>2. This would be a means of putting away evil from among them, which may be underſtood two ways.</p>
               <p>1. It would put away the evil of ſin, becauſe puniſhing the falſe witneſs would deter others from becoming falſe witneſſes.</p>
               <p>2. It would put away the evil of puniſhment; for if they connive at falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which oppreſs innocent perſons, this will bring down God's Judgments upon themſelves as well as theſe falſe witneſſes.</p>

                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 8. Whereas theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> and their adherents, do not only privately accuſe theſe Miniſters and their hearers to the Magiſtrates, but ſometimes take upon them to get Officers and Souldiers, and come to their Aſſemblies in a rude and hoſtile manner, and diſturb them while they are in the worſhip and ſervice of God, and do put on that impudence as to call to the Miniſter, that is praying or preaching to come down, I would adviſe them to conſider two or three things:</p>
               <p>1. What an irreligious action this is, how inconſiſtent with the fear of God, and with the reverence which is due to men made after the image of God, to diſturb the ſervants of God for doing thoſe things which are commanded of God, in the very time and ſeaſon that they are worſhipping and ſerving the Lord. God is to be feared at all times and places, but more eſpecially the awe and dread of God is to be upon us, when his ſervants are aſſembled to worſhip him, and we are preſent at their Aſſemblies, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89.7. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence of all that are round about him.</hi> Do you fear God greatly, when you come into the Aſſemblies of his Saints, and call to them in the time of their devotion to leave off the ſervice of God?</p>
               <p>2. What befel <hi>Uzzah</hi> for putting forth his hand, and taking hold of the Ark, when the oxen that carried it ſtumbled, and the Ark ſhook, God was angry with him, and ſmote him with ſudden death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Uzzah put forth his hand to the Ark of God, and took hold of it, for the oxen ſhook it. And the anger of the Lord
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102521:36"/>was kindled againſt Uzzah. And God ſmote him there for his errour, and he died. Uzzah</hi>'s taking hold of the Ark, was no malicious act, no plotted, deliberate, wilful ſin; but an errour, a raſh action; yet for this errour and raſhneſs, he dyed upon the place where his ſin was committed; though it is likely, he had a good end in what he did. If raſhneſs and errour in taking hold of the Ark, a type of God's preſence among the Jews, was puniſhed with ſuch ſeverity in <hi>Uzzah;</hi> what ſeverity may theſe men expect from God, for premeditated and deliberate acts of violence againſt his ſervants who are temples of God; and have God really and truly dwelling in them by his holy Spirit, when they hale them out of their Aſſemblies, and force them to deſiſt from the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>3. Remember what befel <hi>Jeroboam</hi> for ſtretching out his hand to take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for delivering the Lords meſſage, his hand was ſuddenly dryed up, that he could not pull it in again, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13, 14, <hi>And it came to paſs when King Jeroboam heard the ſaying of the man of God, which had cryed againſt the Altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the Altar, and ſaid, Lay hold on him. And his hand which he put forth againſt him dryed up, ſo that he could not pull it in again to him. Jeroboam</hi> was a King, yet for attempting to take hold of a Prophet for doing the work God ſet him about, this remarkable and ſudden Judgment of God came upon him. If God dealt thus with ſuch a tall Cedar, what may the ſhrubs expect? Theſe men that take upon them to lay hold of the Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt, while they are about the Lords work, and call them to ceaſe, may fear leſt their tongues ſhould cleave to the roof of their mouths, or their arms wither, or ſome other great Judgment ſhould fall upon them in the act of their ſin.</p>
               <p>4 Let that Judgment alſo which fell upon the Captains and Soldiers that went to <hi>Elijah,</hi> and called to him to come down, be minded by thoſe that fetch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers to the Aſſemblies of theſe men, and take upon them to call them to come down out of their Pulpits, when they are praying to God or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the people. It concerns theſe <hi>Informers</hi> and thoſe Officers and Soldiers that come along with them, to be awakened by this Judgment, to take heed what they do againſt theſe men, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.9, 10, <hi>Then the King ſent to him a Captain of fifty with his fifty, and he went up to him, and behold he ſate on the top of an hill. And he ſpake unto him, Thou man of God, the King hath ſaid, come down. And Elijah anſwered and ſaid unto the Captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and conſume thee and thy fifty: And there came down fire from heaven, and conſumed him and his fifty.</hi> The ſame Judgment of fire from Heaven for the ſame ſin, came upon another Captain of fifty and his fifty, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. The ſin of theſe <hi>Informers,</hi> and the Officers and Soldiers that come with them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the ſervants of God, and call to the Miniſters to come down, is in my apprehenſion far greater than the ſin of thoſe Captains and their Companies, that called to <hi>Elijah</hi> to come down; and that in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. Thoſe Captains were ſent by the King's own order, and did but deliver the King's meſſage, <hi>The King hath ſaid, Come down;</hi> yet this did not exempt them from being conſumed, that they had order for what they did, that they were ſent by lawful Authority; but theſe <hi>Informers</hi> come of their own head, prompted on uſually, either by covetouſneſs or malice.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe Captains did not diſturb <hi>Elijah</hi> when he was at his devotion, they did not interrupt him when he was praying to God, or preaching to the people. But theſe <hi>Informers</hi> come in the time that theſe men are worſhipping of God, and diſturb and call to them to come down while they are ſerving God, which aggravates their ſin.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102521:36"/>
               <p>3. Thoſe Captains did not themſelves, or any of their company touch <hi>Elijah</hi>'s perſon, or his eſtate; but theſe <hi>Informers</hi> procure Officers to hale theſe men out of their Meetings, to break open their houſes, and to carry away their goods.</p>
               <p>4. It's hard to ſay what was the ſin of thoſe Captains that were conſumed with fire from Heaven for calling to <hi>Elijah</hi> to come down: Whether they ſpake to the Prophet in a rude inſulting manner, or not with that reſpect that became a Prophet (for the other Captain that went to him in an humble manner was ſpared) or becauſe they knew there was evil determined againſt <hi>Elijah</hi> by the King, and yet they would be inſtrumental to fetch him; or whether they ſpoke to him, in a ſcoffing manner; though all the people held him for a Prophet, yet it may be they did not, and ſo might call him the man of God in way of deriſion. But in the actings of theſe <hi>Informers</hi> there is a complication of many abominable ſins; which are viſible and hateful to God and all good men: Yea, the common ſort of people ſee and deteſt the odious practices of theſe men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But <hi>Elijah</hi> was a Prophet, ſhould we call to a Prophet when he was praying and preaching to come down; or ſhould we get Officers and Soldiers to pull them out of their Pulpits and diſperſe their Aſſemblies, we might be afraid leaſt fire ſhould come down from Heaven, and conſume us, and all that come along with us; but we do not fear any ſuch thing in reference to theſe men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Chriſt that live in theſe days of the Goſpel, are to be reſpected as much as the Prophets that lived under the Law. And the affronts and injuries offered unto them are as offenſive to God, as the injuries that were done unto the Prophets by the Jews. If you be not ſatisfied in the truth of this aſſertion, weigh what our Lord Jeſus ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.9, 11. <hi>What went you out for to ſee, a Prophet, yea, I ſay unto you, and more than a Prophet. Verily, I ſay unto you, Among them that are born of women, there hath not been a greater than John the Baptiſt, notwithſtanding he that is leſt in the Kingdom of God is greater than be.</hi> There was a clearer diſcovery of Chriſt in the days of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt than in the time of the Prophets, and therefore he is preferred above the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, equallized to all that were born of women by our Lord Jeſus. But after the death of Chriſt there was a fuller and clearer manifeſtation of Chriſt, than when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt lived; and therefore our Lord Jeſus in this reſpect, namely, of the excellency and clearneſs of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the leaſt Miniſters under the New Teſtament above <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, not that they excel or are equal to him in holineſs, but have a more clear knowledge of the Meſſiah than he had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt in theſe days have like precious faith with the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Simon Peter a ſervant, and an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us, through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And there are no gifts or priviledges that commend a man to God like faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6, <hi>For in Jeſus Chriſt, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but ſaith which worketh by love.</hi> God loves all that believe in his Son, as he did <hi>Elijah,</hi> and he will avenge the wrongs done unto them as he did what was done unto <hi>Elijah.</hi> For their faith is a-like precious in the ſight of God, with the faith of <hi>Elijah.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. There is no fire that cometh down from Heaven to conſume us, as there did upon the Captains that went to apprehend <hi>Elijah;</hi> but we enrich our ſelves this way, and therefore our ſin is not ſo bad as theirs was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though fire do not come down from heaven, and conſume you, yet there is fire in hell prepared, and reſerved for you, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.17, <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> And the fire which is in hell is more dreadful, than that which came down from Heaven. For,</p>
               <p>1. That fire conſumed the Captains, and the Soldiers that were with with them; but the fire of hell though it torments you it will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you.</p>
               <p>2. That fire laſted but a little while, but the fire of hell will laſt for ever, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.41, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Your being let alone in your ſins will prove a greater Judgment, if you perſiſt in your ſins without repentance, than if fire ſhould come down from Heaven and conſume you; for by going on in your ſins without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, you treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your iniquities; and ſo will have a greater degree of torment in the other world for ever.</p>

This example of God's conſuming thoſe Captains with their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that came to apprehend <hi>Elijah</hi> by fire from Heaven, is recorded to deter all perſons from offering violence to any of the Lords Prophets or Meſſengers, to the end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11, <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for enſamples, and they are written for our admonition; on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Humble Advice to Magiſtrates not to countenance theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, nor to ſuppreſs the Non-conformiſt Miniſters or their Meetings.</head>
               <p>SEeing theſe Informers are wont to addreſs themſelves to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and bring falſe accuſations to them againſt theſe Miniſters called Non-conformiſts; informing them that they keep Seditious Conventicles, and do thereby excite and ſtir them up to impriſon or fine thoſe Miniſters, and ſuppreſs their Aſſemblies. I ſhall crave leave before I conclude this diſcourſe, humbly to adviſe and requeſt thoſe Magiſtrates to whom theſe Informers addreſs themſelves for aſſiſtance in their undertakings. Firſt, That they would not give any countenance to this generation of men, that take upon them the employ of being Informers. Secondly, That they do not at their inſtigation puniſh the Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt, when no other Crime can be proved againſt them; but that they have been praying to God in the Name of his Son, or that they have been Preaching or hearing his Holy Word.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My humble requeſt to you is, that you would give no countenance or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to this ſort of Men. And that for Gods ſake, in whoſe ſtead you are placed in the world; for your own ſake, and for the Kingdom ſake, that guilt and wrath come not upon your ſelves, and upon the Kingdom; for the ſake of theſe Informers that they be not multiplyed and increaſed. Give me leave to touch briefly on theſe Heads. 1. You are Gods Vicegerents, you ſtand in his Room, and Rule in his ſtead. When God made <hi>Moſes</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over <hi>Aron,</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> he tells him, <hi>Thou ſhalt be to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God. Exod.</hi> 4.16. You rule and judge not for your ſelves, but for the Lord who ſtands by and obſerves what you ſay, and what you do, and therefore you had need take heed what judgment you paſs upon every man that comes before you. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Take heed what you do, for ye judg not for men, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.</hi> And ſeeing you ſtand in Gods ſtead, and rule and judge for him; Look how the Lord God would carry himſelf, if he were in your Places; ſo ye ought to carry your ſelves, whom he would encourage, thoſe you ought to encourage; whom he would rebuke and reprove; thoſe ye ought to rebuke and reprove. Now conſider with your ſelves, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt were on Earth and were in your place, and theſe Informers came unto him to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Servants for praying and Preaching and hearing his Word; what are your thoughts? and what do your Conſciences tell you he would do in this caſe? would he countenance or reprove and Puniſh them? ſurely he would give no Countenance to ſuch vile perſons in ſuch a ſinful undertaking. 2. By aſiſting theſe men, you will bring down Gods Wrath upon your ſelves,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102521:38"/>and the Nation. Upon your ſelves: To evidence this, weigh what was ſaid by the Prophet to <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Shouldſt thou help the ungodly? and love them that bate the Lord? Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</hi> This Wrath came upon <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> for helping <hi>Ahab</hi> in fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Syrians.</hi> Here let it be conſidered, 1. That <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was a great man; he was King of <hi>Judah;</hi> he was alſo a good man. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there are good things in thee, in that thou haſt taken away the groves out of the Land, and haſt prepared thy Heart to ſeek God.</hi> Yet neither his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor his goodneſs kept of the wrath of God from him for helping an ungodly man. 2. <hi>Ahab</hi> whom <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> helped was a King, King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And it might ſeem good policy for one neighbouring Paince to help another: Becauſe by helping <hi>Ahab</hi> he might have had his help another time againſt the adverſaries of <hi>Juda,</hi> yet neither did this excuſe him. 3. The Perſons againſt whom <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> helped <hi>Ahab</hi> were the Syrians. And the Syrians were Idolaters that Worſhipped ſtrange Gods. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.23. They were alſo great enemies. to the Kingdoms of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah. Jer.</hi> 9.12. <hi>The Syrians before and the Philiſtines behind, and they ſhall devour Iſrael with open Mouth.</hi> They were a People devoted to deſtruction. 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 20.42. Now if <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> incurred the diſpleaſure of God for helping <hi>Ahab,</hi> becauſe he was an ungodly man; to ſuppreſs the Syrians who were Idolators and enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> How can you think but that you ſhall bring down the Wrath of God upon your ſelves, if you help theſe Informers, who go about to oppreſs and ſuppreſs the Servants of the true and Living God; while they are worſhiping &amp; ſerving the Lord. If it be ſaid, It doth not appear to you, that theſe Informers are ungodly men, and ſuch as hate the Lord; you do not judge them like <hi>Ahab,</hi> that had ſold himſelf to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſight of the Lord. If you did, then you might fear God would be angry with you for being helpful to them. To that I anſwer, 1. If you pleaſe to peruſe thoſe demonſtrations which I have given out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Evil of their ways, in the ſecond of <hi>Chron.</hi> you may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that their practices are not conſiſtent with godlyneſs. In ſome reſpects thoſe men are worſe then <hi>Ahab,</hi> for when <hi>Ahab</hi> was reproved by <hi>Elijah</hi> for taking a poſſeſſion of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, which he had gotten by unjuſt means; he humbled himſelf before God, and Faſted, and rent his Cloaths, and lay in Sackcloth. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27.29. But we hear of no Humilliation from theſe men, after they have been reproved for taking into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion other mens Goods, which they obtain by undue means. And as you will bring the Wrath of God upon your ſelves ſo alſo upon the Nation, if you countenance and incourage this ſort of Men. When the Rulers do not puniſh evil doers, they bring guilt and Wrath not only upon themſelves but upon the Nation where they live; how much more if they give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13.17, 18. <hi>Then I contended with the Nobles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and ſaid unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and prophane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this Citie? yet ye bring, more Wrath upon Iſarel, by prophaning the Sabbath.</hi> They were the meaner ſort of the People that prophaned the Sabbath, ſuch as bare burthens, trode the Winepreſs, ſold Fiſh and other wares, <hi>v.</hi> 15.16. And becauſe the Nobles did not reſtrain them, what theſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102521:38"/>men did is laid to the Charge of the Nobles. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells them they brought Wrath upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> by prophaning the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you carry it toward thoſe men as though they were righteous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting them when complaints and appeals are made to you, or rewarding them as though they had done well, when their iniquity and folly is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and hateful almoſt to all men, you will loſe your reſpect among the People, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24, 25. <hi>He that ſaith to the Wicked thou art Righteous, him ſhall the People Curſe, Nations ſhall abhor him. But to them that rebuke him ſhall be delight and a good Bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They are uſually the baſeſt of men that take upon them this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men of a very ill ſame in the Place where they live, if their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations were Looked into, there are ſuch Blots upon ſome of them, as would make them abhorred of all ſober men. And if ſuch men be exalted, countenanced, and rewarded, it will cauſe Wickedneſs, and Wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to abound in the Nation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. <hi>The Wicked walk on every ſide, when the vileſt perſons are exalted.</hi> If you harken to the Lying informations, theſe men bring againſt innocent Perſons, it will not only incourage them, but others alſo to Tread in their Steps. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.11. <hi>If a ruler hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lyes, all his Servants are Wicked.</hi> But if you would ſhew your ſelves angry with them for Backbiting and Slandring thoſe that are peaceable, you would ſoon free your ſelves from the Trouble of theſe men, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.23. <hi>The North Wind driveth away Rain, ſo doth an angry Countenance a backbiting tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. My humble requeſt to you is that you would not puniſh any of the Miniſters or other Servants of Chriſt; when no other Crime is or can be proved againſt them; but their meeting together to pray to God in the name of Chriſt; or to preach and hear his holy Word. The advice which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> gave the rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Apoſtles were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council for Preaching, after they had received ſtrict Charge to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear teaching the People was wiſe and ſeaſonable advice. I humbly offer the ſame to you. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.38, 39. <hi>Refrain from theſe men and let them alone, for if this Council or this Work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrough it, leſt happily ye be found even to ſight againſt God.</hi> That this advice may be more effectual; I humbly intreat you to conſider.</p>
               <p>1. What a ſtrict charge the Lord Jeſus hath given his Miniſters to preach his word. He chargeth them three times as they love him, to feed his Sheep and his Lambs, <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. <hi>Jeſus ſaid to Simon Peter. Simon Son of Jonas Loveſt thou me more than thoſe? Feed my Lambs. Loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep. Loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep.</hi> He chargeth them as they will anſwer the neglect thereof at the day of Judgment to preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and dead at his appearing. Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and long ſuffering.</hi> He hath laid it upon them as a neceſſary duty to Preach the Goſpel, and pronounces a Wo againſt them that neglect it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me: Yea Wo unto me, if I Preach not the Goſpel.</hi> Will ye forbid, will puniſh theſe men for doing that for which they have ſuch a ſtrict command from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:102521:39"/>
               <p>2. Conſider what a high reſpect and dear love the Lord Jeſus beareth to all thoſe, that hear his word and do it. He loveth and honoureth them, as he loved and honoured his Mother and his Brethren, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.20, 21. <hi>And it was told him by certain that ſaid, Thy Mother and thy Brethren ſtand without deſiring to ſee thee. And he anſwered and ſaid, my Mother and my Brethren are theſe which hear the word of God, and do it.</hi> If the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Chriſt were now upon the earth, you would offer no injury to her, you would not diſturb her at her devotion, you would not puniſh her for hearing the word of God, but ſhew all reſpect to her. You ſhould be as unwilling to offer any violence, or ſuffer any wrong to be done to thoſe that hear and do the word of God; as you would to the Mother and Brethren of Chriſt; For he loveth and reſpecteth them that hear and do Gods word as he did his Mother and his Brethren.</p>
               <p>3. Remember what a charge the Lord hath given you not to touch his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted and do his prophers no harm, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105.15. <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi> This charge is given in an eſpecial manner to Rulers and Governors, as appears from the foregoing words. <hi>He reproved Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</hi> By his anointed, whom he would not have you touch, <hi>Fiſcator</hi> and ſeveral other interpreters underſtand, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctos donis Spiritus Sancti.</hi> Such as are anointed with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. The pouring out of the Spirit is called an Unction; and the anoynting, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 27. Prophets were of two ſorts; firſt, ſuch as had an extraordinary call, and could foretel things to come. Secondly as were qualified, and called to teach and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; though they had no extraordinary gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. <hi>He that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth ſpeaketh unto men, to ediſication, and exhortation and confort.</hi> And ſo the word prophet is uſed. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. for a Miniſter of the Goſpel. Now though this charge of not touching his anoynted, and doing his prophets no harm, was primarily given to thoſe rulers, where <hi>Ahraham</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſojourned: yet it equally concerneth all rulers in all ages; not to touch thoſe he hath anointed with his holy Spirit, and to do no harm to any of his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>4. Let it be conſidered that Praying and Preaching are means appointed by God for the ſaving mens ſouls. Prayer is a means of obtaining ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved. Amos.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto the houſe of Iſrael; Seek ye me, and ye ſhall live.</hi> And the Preaching the Goſpel is a ſpecial means for obtaining ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth.</hi> Yea even that Preaching which the world derides and counts Fooliſhneſs, God bleſſeth it to the ſaving of Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>After that in the Wiſdom of God, the World by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to ſave them that believe.</hi> And the ſaving of Souls from hell torments is a work of the greateſt moment in the whole world. The Eternal Son of God became man, and humbled himſelf to death to the painful accurſed death of the Croſs, to ſave loſt Souls. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> And great care ſhould be uſed that we do not hinder the obtaining that for which Chriſt ſhed his precious blood.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102521:39"/>The greateſt good we can do for any man is to further, and the greateſt hurt is to hinder his Salvation.</p>
               <p>5. It is recorded to the honour of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he was an encourager of all that did faithfully diſpence the word of God. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30.22. <hi>Hezekiah ſpeak comfortably to all the Levites, that taught the good knowledge of the Lord.</hi> And as he did incourage the Miniſters of Gods word, ſo God did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bleſs him, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 31.30. <hi>Hezekiah proſpered in all his works.</hi> And it is recorded of <hi>Herod</hi> as one of his chief ſins, that he impriſoned one of Gods Miniſters. <hi>Luk</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>But Herod the Tetrarch, being reproved by him for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias his brother Philips wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this above all, that he ſhut up John in priſon, Herod</hi> was guilty of many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but this is noted as the principal, as that which was above all the reſt, that he ſhut up <hi>John</hi> in priſon. And as it is a great ſin to afflict the Miniſters and ſervants of Chriſt, ſo it is uſally followed with a ſore judgment. <hi>Herod</hi> who ſtretched forth his hand to vex certain of the Church, ſoon after dyed in a miſerable manner being eaten up of Worms. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 23. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> and would not let them go to ſerve the Lord in the wilderneſs, was followed with one plague after another till he was deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>6. Rulers ought not to be a terrour to ſuch as do good works, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and protect them, <hi>Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the evill. Wilt thou then not be affraid of the power, do that which is good, and thou ſhall have praiſe of the ſame.</hi> Preaching of the Goſpel whereby men may be ſaved, and praying to God in the name of Chriſt are good works, and therefore rulers ought not to be a terrour to any man for theſe works.</p>
               <p>7. We are taught and Commanded by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to pray to the Lord to ſend forth labourers into his Vineyard, becauſe the harveſt is great, and the labourers are but few, <hi>Then ſaid he to his diſciples, The harveſt truly is plentious, but the labourers are but few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harveſt, that he will ſend forth labourers into his harveſt.</hi> To pray for labourers, and when God hath ſent them forth to moleſt and trouble them for labouring is to contradict our prayers. Let the Ignorance, Atheiſm, Profaneneſs, the growth of Errour, and the ſmall number of Preachers that are found in the Faith, and of an holy converſation, be conſidered and laid to heart, and it will evidently appear; that there is great need of prayer for more Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and of encouraging thoſe that are ſent forth, and of not ſuppreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are faithful, peaceable, and diligent in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. If it be replyed. Theſe informers accuſe theſe Miniſters, that they keep ſeditious Conventicles, and are ready to give oath of it, and as ſuch we are obliged by the Law to ſuppreſs them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. Rulers ought to be wiſe as an Angel of God, to diſcern good from evil. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14, 17. <hi>As an Angel of God, ſo is my Lord the King to deſcern good and bad.</hi> And that is no hard matter in the Noon day of the Goſpel to diſtinguiſh between Religion and ſedition. When <hi>Job</hi> was a Ruler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his People, he was diligent to ſearch out the truth of all cauſes that came before him; and when he found any Wicked man oppreſſing the righteous, he was ſo far from rewarding him, that he plucked the Spoil out of his Teeth, and if he held it faſt and would not let it go, he break his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102521:40"/>Jaws rather than ſuffer him to hold his Spoils. <hi>Job</hi> 29.16, 17. <hi>The Cauſe which I knew not I ſearched out; I break the Jaws of the wicked, and pulled the Spoil out of his Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Miniſters, as was hinted before, do abhor ſeditious Conventicles and are falſly accuſed by theſe Informers, and Magiſtrates ſhould be ſlow to believe their falſe accuſations; and not proceed to Act againſt them till they have ſearched into the truth of theſe informations, and that for ſeveral reaſons, as 1. The great enmity that is in the heart of the Wicked againſt Righteous men, which makes them eager to do them all the Miſchief they can. The Scripture ſpeaks ſo frequently and ſo fully of this, that I ſhall need to ſay the leſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.16. <hi>They ſleep not except they have done Miſchief, and their Sleep is taken away unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall. Pſ.</hi> 37.19, 32. <hi>The Wicked plotteth againſt the juſt, and gnaſheth upon him with his Teeth. The Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed watcheth the Righteous and ſeeketh to ſlay him.</hi> 2. They are under a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of gain; and the Love of Mony is the Root of all evil, and therefore it is no wonder if they prove falſe accuſers of them againſt whom they have a great enmity, and by accuſing of whom they make a great advantage. 3. The rule that is given to Magiſtrates in the word of God, is not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Puniſhment upon reports till they have made diligent ſearch, and have certain proof of the truth of the fact. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15. <hi>If thou ſhalt hear ſay — Then ſhalt thou enquire, and make ſearch and ask diligently; and behold if it be truth, and the thing certain that ſuch abomination is wrought among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Miniſters and thoſe that aſſemble with them are oftentimes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſentence paſſed upon them for to take away their Goods, before they have been heard, or had their accuſers Face to Face; yea ſometimes before they know who it is that hath accuſed them; and this ſeemeth to me to be againſt the Light and Law of Nature: which teacheth that a man ought not to be condemned till he hath had his accuſers face to face, and hath had Licence to anſwer for himſelf. The Romans had no other Light to regulate them in their judicial proceedings, but the Light of Nature; yet they obſerved this Rule, not to paſs ſentence upon a man, till he had his accuſers face to face, and had liberty to anſwer for himſelf. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16. <hi>It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to dy, before he that is accuſed, hath the accuſers face to face, and have Liberty to anſwer for himſelf, concerning the Crime laid againſt him.</hi> If the Romans, which were Heathens, how much more ſhould Chriſtian Magiſtrates, forbear condemning any man till he hath ſeen his accuſers, heard his accuſation, and been Permitted to make his own defence. The name of <hi>Pilat</hi> is odious in the Chriſtian World, and will be to all generations, for Condemning our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be put to Death, yet he ſhewed ſo much juſtice in his carriage, he would not give ſentence againſt him, till he had examined him, and his accuſers, and had heard what he could ſay for himſelf. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.13. <hi>And Pilat when he had called together the chief Prieſts and the Rulers and the People ſaid unto them, ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the People; and behold I having examined him before you &amp; have found no fault in this man touching thoſe things whereof you accuſe him</hi> Neither the hainouſneſs of the Crime object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Chriſt, as Blaſpheming, going about to make himſelf a King, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102521:40"/>the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor the greatneſs or multitude of his accuſers, (the chief Prieſts, Rulers, Elders, and the People were combined together) nor the impetuouſneſs of his adverſaries, who Thirſted after his Blood, and cryed out with one conſent, Crucify him, Crucify him, could prevail with <hi>Pilat,</hi> to give ſentence againſt Chriſt, till he had examined him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his accuſers. Let it not be ſaid that any Chriſtian Magiſtrates come ſhort of the juſtice <hi>Pilat</hi> ſhewed, or pretended to ſhew, who was the Condemner of Chriſt, That ſuch inconſiderable Perſons as theſe Informers ſhould prevail with them, to Condemn men fearing God, and give out War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to deſtrain their goods, without examining them before their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and hearing what they are able to ſay for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the pretence of the Informers, that theſe men tranſgreſs the Act made to prevent ſeditious Conventicles, I have anſwered that Plea, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. Plea. 5. whither I refer the Reader. Where I have proved, that the Meetings of theſe Miniſters called Nonconformiſts, are no tranſgreſſion of that Act, according to that Charitable interpretation that may be put upon it. And I quoted a Paſſage out of Dr. <hi>Jeremiah Taylour,</hi> concerning the interpretation of Laws, which was this, <hi>All Laws do infinitely decline all harſh ſenſe., and are ambitious of gentle benign interpretations.</hi> Which if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as true in the interpretation of this Law, in my judgment the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe men are not Puniſhable by that Law; becauſe thoſe Meetings that are Puniſhable by that Law, muſt be in other manner than according to the Liturgy, and the practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which though the informers Swear, (becauſe they do either not underſtand or not fear an Oath) yet they will not be able to prove. For they muſt be able to prove, that they are in other manner than according to the holy Scripture: (which they cannot do) becauſe, 1. The holy Scriptures which are read for the firſt and ſecond Leſſon, are a great part of The Liturgy of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and therefore what Meetings are not in other manner,, than is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe Portions of Scripture preſcribed to be read by the Liturgy, are not in other manner than according to the Liturgy. 2. If theſe informers will contend and Swear, That though theſe meetings be not in other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than according to the holy Scriptures; yet they are in other manner than according to the Liturgy, this would ſet the Liturgy and the Scripture at variance, and ſuch a concluſion would be drawn from hence as might make them Puniſhable for depraving the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If it be ſaid theſe meetings are in other Manner than according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe Miniſters deſire no further favour than to argue this caſe with the Informers in the preſence of the Magiſtrates. And if they cannot Juſtify whatever they do out of the Word of God, they will contentedly ſuffer what theſe Magiſtrates ſhall ſee meet to inflict upon them.</p>
               <p>And if all Laws do infinitely decline all harſh ſences, I would appeal to all Sober men, whether this be not an harſh ſence to interpret a Law made to ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles, in ſuch a ſence as to Puniſh men for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Religious Duties? And whether this be not an harſh ſence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, thoſe Meetings that are not in other manner than according to the Holy Scriptures, to be in other manner than according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Suppoſe ſome pretenders to Religion have Plotted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102521:41"/>under a colour of religious exerciſes (ſuch practices and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I abhor as much as other men, I ſpeak not one word in their behalf) yet this doth not take off the harſhneſs of the interpretation; ſo to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret a Law made to prevent ſedition and inſurrection, as to Puniſh ſuch as meet for no other end but to glorify God, and work out their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If a ſtrict Law were made to prevent Drunkenneſs, and becauſe many have made themſelves drunk with Wine or Strong drink; to interpret this Law, ſo as to Puniſh a man that hath a weakly Stomach, and drinks Wine moderately to help his digeſtion, or to Puniſh a man that goeth to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern upon weighty Buſineſs; would be judged a harſh interpretation of the Law, to Puniſh ſober men for the uſe of that which others have abuſed: ſo here, becauſe ſome have abuſed private Meetings, to interpret a Law againſt ſeditious Meetings; ſo as to Puniſh thoſe that uſe Meetings in an holy and Religious manner, ſeems to me an harſh interpretation of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It may be ſome will ſay, we cannot, we dare not ſay to the contrary, but many of the Non-conformiſts are righteous and peaceable men, and we are not able to prove their Meetings are in other manner than according to the Holy Scriptures; and if we could avoid it, we would not moleſt theſe men or their Meetings; for it is againſt our Conſciences to break them up, or to fine them: But theſe Informers are buſy men, and they may poſſibly make us loſe an hundred pounds, if we do not anſwer their deſire in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing theſe Meetings, and fining thoſe that are preſent at them. If it were not that we feared the loſs of an hundred pounds, we would not meddle with theſe men and their Meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have not heard of any Magiſtrate that hath ſuffered on this account, and if any Informer ſhould ariſe to that Impudence, as to Sue any Magiſtrate, for not moleſting theſe Men or their Meetings, I have more charitable thoughts of the Law, and of thoſe that Execute them, than to think that any Magiſtrate ſhould be Fined for not puniſhing thoſe Men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom nothing of Sedition can be proved, nor any thing elſe, but that they meet together to pray to God, in the Name of Chriſt, for things agreeable to his Will, and to Preach and hear his holy Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſuch as are under a Temptation of acting contrary to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, for fear of the loſs of an hundred pounds; I may ſay as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> when he asked him, <hi>But what ſhall we do for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents? And the man of God anſwered, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. An hundred Talents is more than an hundred pounds; and if God could make up the loſs of an hundred Talents to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> is he not able to give you much more than an hundred pounds. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh Rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it, Prov.</hi> 10.12. The Lord can by his bleſſing make up your loſs by proſpering you in your callings, by caſting an Inheritance upon you by the death of Friends, by keeping off expenſive ſickneſſes, or by giving it to your Poſterity, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ways.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If for ſaving an hundred pounds you will ſin againſt God, and your own Conſciences; God can take away more than that ſuddenly from you: Either by Fire, or by loſſes at Sea, or decay of Trade, or miſcarrying of Debtors, or by expenſive ſickneſſes, or giving you riotous Children, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102521:41"/>you fall into the hand of the Extortioner, or divers other ways. Or elſe God can ſend ſuch trouble upon your Conſciences, that your Eſtate ſhall do you no good, but you ſhall wiſh an hundred times, that you had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loſs of all that you have, rather than to have ſinned againſt your Conſcience. What good did <hi>Francis Spira</hi> his eſtate do him, after he had ſinned againſt his Conſcience to preſerve his Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are more material queſtions to be asked in this Caſe, than what you ſhould do to prevent the loſs of an hundred pounds; as, What you ſhould do to keep a good Conſcience? For a good Conſcience is more worth than all the world. What you ſhould do that you may not ſin againſt God? For a man ſhould chooſe the greateſt loſs before the leaſt ſin. What account you ſhall be able to give of your actions at the day of Judgment? For that is the rule we are to walk by; <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do ye, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty, Jam.</hi> 2 12. We ſhould under go any loſs, rather than do any action, which we cannot give an account of at the day of judgment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Give me leave to put you in mind of <hi>Balaam,</hi> what he ſaid, what he did, and what befel him, when he was ſent for to curſe <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and to hint ſomething from his example in reference to the Informers that come to you to break up the Aſſemblies of theſe men. 1. <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſent for by a King, and the Meſſengers that came on the Errand of <hi>Balack</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite <hi>Balaam</hi> to Curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were Honourable Perſons, the Princes of <hi>Moab:</hi> yet he would not go with them till he had conſulted with God, whether it were his will that he ſhould go with theſe men; and he made them tarry a Night before he gave them their anſwer; and then underſtanding that it was the will of God that he ſhould not go, he reſolved not to go with them, though ſent for by a King. <hi>Num</hi> 22.7, 8, 12, 13, 14. 2. The Princes of <hi>Moab</hi> brought great rewards to give to <hi>Balaam, v.</hi> 9. they made him great profers, and Promiſes, if he would go with them, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, <hi>Thus ſaith Balaam: Let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me; for I will promote thee to great Honour, and I will do whatſoever thou ſaiſt unto me. Come therefore I pray thee; and Curſe me this People;</hi> Here are great intreaties in the name of a King. <hi>Come I pray thee. Let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming.</hi> And great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of great Promotion, and giving all that he would ask. But what ſaid <hi>Balaam</hi> till God gave him leave, they could not get him to go: though <hi>Balack</hi> would have given him his Houſe (and no doubt but <hi>Balacks</hi> houſe was a large one fit for a King) as full of Silver and Gold, as it could hold. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>And Balaam anſwered the Servants of Balaek: If Balack would give me his houſe full of Silver and Gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do more or leſs.</hi> 3. When <hi>Balaam</hi> was prevailed with to go, thinking he had got Leave from God, the Angel of God met him, holding a drawn Sword in his hand and would have Slain him, had not the Aſſe eſpyed the Angel and turned out of the way, <hi>v.</hi> 22.23, 32, 33. 4. When <hi>Balaam</hi> did go to <hi>Balack,</hi> he did not Curſe Iſrael at all, but bleſſed them, though he angred <hi>Balack,</hi> and loſt all his preferments thereby, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.10, 15. <hi>And Balacks anger was kindled againſt Balaam, and he ſmote his hands together, and ſaid, I called thee to curſe mine enemies; and behold, thou haſt altogether bleſſed them theſe three times, therefore now flee to thy place; I thought to promote thee to great Honour, but the Lord hath kept thee back from honour.</hi> Theſe things did <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he was ſent for to curſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here let it be conſidered, 1. Whether our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102521:42"/>muſt not exceed the righteouſneſs of <hi>Balaam,</hi> if we enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, ſeeing he lived and died a South-ſayer, <hi>Joſh</hi> 13.22. And though he had the gift of Propheſie, he is ſtiled a mad Propher, and branded with loving the ways of unrighteouſneſs. 2. Whether the people of God in theſe days be not as dear to him as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were of old? 3. Whether <hi>malè facere</hi> be not as had as <hi>malè dicere?</hi> whether to afflict and hurt in deeds, be not as had as to hurt in words; <hi>ſeeing the curſe cauſleſs ſhall not come,</hi> Prov. 26.2. <hi>And ſure there is no Divination againſt Jacob, nor Inchantment againſt Iſrael.</hi> Theſe things premiſed, I would crave leave to adviſe you. 1. When theſe Informers come to you to puniſh the Miniſters of the Goſpel for Preaching Gods Word, or to break up their Meetings, you ſhould do well to ask Counſel of God, whether it be his will you ſhould go with theſe men, and do what they would have you do and make them wait your leiſure till you be ſatisfied in your Conſcience of the lawfulneſs thereof. <hi>Balaam</hi> did thus, though he was ſent for by a King; though Princes came to him, he would not go till he had adviſed with God. Thoſe Men that come to you are uſually mean and beggar'y perſons; and therefore they may well tarry your leiſure. I have wondred at the haſte of ſome men, who, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, have left all, yea, the ſervice of God, to follow theſe men. This is far ſhort of <hi>Balaam.</hi> 2. If you be not ſatisfied that it is the Will of God that you ſhould go with theſe men; whatever entreaties they uſe, whatever arguments they lay before you go not with them. <hi>Balaam</hi> reſuſed to go with the Princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> though entreated, though profer'd great rewards, when it was againſt the Will of God. Theſe men bring no reward, but ſhame and reproach, and the ill will of your neighbours, and yet how forward are many to go with them. 3. If upon ſerious conſideration you think you may lawfully go with theſe men, take heed you be not deceived, and take heed to your ſpirits, that you go with a right Spirit. <hi>Balaam</hi> thought he had gotten leave from God to go with <hi>Balack</hi>'s meſſengers, he thought he had good warrant to go, for God had ſaid, <hi>If the men come to call thee, riſe up and go with them.</hi> Which ſome conceive to be ſpoken Ironically, others by way of Indignation; ſeeing he had tempted God by coming again to enquire of his going; when he knew it was expreſly againſt his mind; He ſpake in anger, and ſaid, Riſe up and go with them. Or if he had leave, there was covetouſneſs, or malice, or ſome other evil in his heart; whether he had a Warrant to go or not, I do not now enquire, but this is certain God was angry with him for going, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Gods anger was kindled againſt him, becauſe he went.</hi> And he was in danger to be ſlain by the Angel that ſtood in the way.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If you think your ſelves obliged by virtue of the Law to go along with theſe Informers, if you find nothing of Sedition in the Aſſembly to which they carry you; if you find them met in a peaceable manner, Preaching ſound Doctrine, praying for things agreeable to the Will of God; inſtead of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, or puniſhing them, leave your bleſſing upon them, and ſay, <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord be upon you,</hi> and puniſh theſe Informers as falſe accuſers. When <hi>Balaam</hi> went to <hi>Balack</hi> inſtead of curſing <hi>Iſiael,</hi> he bleſſed them, though he angred <hi>Balack</hi> thereby; and loſt great honours and promotions. They that will rather curſe an <hi>Iſraelire,</hi> than run the hazard of ſmall loſſes, of loſing their dignities and promotions, come ſhort of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who yet fell ſhort of eternal liſe.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102521:42"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. We have yet one ſcruple more about theſe men, and theſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if we could get over that, we would not moleſt them, and it is this, we ſhall not be accounted the Kings friends, if we do not ſuppreſs theſe Men, but ſhall be accounted friends and favourers of Phanaticks; If it were not for this, we would not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a ſtrong temptation upon ſome men to do irregular things, for fear they ſhould not be eſteemed the Kings friends; as we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Pilat;</hi> he was very loth to have meddled with Chriſt when the Jews brought him. He would know what Crime they had to lay to his charge before he would do ought againſt him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18 29. <hi>What accuſation have ye brought againſt this man?</hi> And when they pretended he was a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, <hi>Pilat</hi> was very deſirous to have been excuſed from meddling in the caſe, verſ. 31. <hi>Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law.</hi> And when they urged him, he vindicated Chriſt, verſ. 32. <hi>I find in him no fault at all.</hi> And when they preſſed hard upon him to crucify Chriſt, he would have put them off again, and told them, he could find no fault in him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>They cryed out ſaying, Crucify him, Crucify him. Pilat ſaith unto them, Take ye him and Crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</hi> Then they plead their Law, that by their Law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Upon hearing this, that it was given out, that he was the Son of God, he was the more afraid to give ſentence againſt him, and ſought which way to releaſe him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.9, 12. Then they uſed this deviſe; they tell <hi>Pilat</hi> he ſhould not be looked upon as <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend if he let Chriſt go. <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſars Friend.</hi> And though he had withſtood the reaſonings and importunities of the Jews hitherto; the hearing of this, that he ſhould not be <hi>Caeſars</hi> Friend, prevailed with him, contrary to his judgment and Conſcience, to deliver up Chriſt to be Crucifyed, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 16. <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caeſars Friend. When therefore Pilat heard this ſaying, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſate down in the judgment ſeat. Then delivered ho him to be Crucifyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If things be duly eſtimated, theſe Informers that Stir up Magiſtrates to Puniſh the Kings Subjects, for praying and Preaching, and thoſe that take in with them will appear to be none of the Kings Friends; but rather his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. For, 1. They that miſuſe Gods Miniſters, bring Gods Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kingdom, as hath been before proved, from, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.16. <hi>They mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his People, till there was no Remedy.</hi> Is not this miſuſing the Lords Prophets and Meſſengers, when they are Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Preaching Gods Word? and whether are they to be reckoned the Kings Friends or Enemies that bring the Wrath of God upon his Kingdom? 2. <hi>David</hi> counted thoſe his Adverſaries that prompted him to Puniſh <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> when he was ſetled upon his Throne in Peace, and yet <hi>Shimei</hi> had curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>David</hi> to his Face in the day of his diſtreſs. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.21, 22. <hi>And Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai the Son of Zervia ſaid, ſhall not Shimei be put to Death for this, becauſe he curſed the Lords anointed. And David ſaid, what have I to do with you, ye Sons of Zervia, that ye ſhould this day be adverſaries unto me? ſhall there any man be put to Death this day in Iſrael; for do I not know that I am this day King in Iſrael.</hi> Theſe men pray for the King and Kingdoms welfare. And if <hi>David</hi> accounted the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> his adverſaries, for ſtiring him up to deſtroy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102521:43"/>
                  <hi>Shimei,</hi> who had curſed him, becauſe he had humbled himſelf, may we not count theſe Informers the Kings Enemies that ſeek the Deſtruction of theſe men, who pray to God both in their Families and Aſſemblies to bleſs the King, and Preach obedience to the King in all lawful things. 3. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People in the Kings honour, but in the want of People is the Kings deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Prov.</hi> 14.28. And therefore to Suppreſs, Impoveriſh, to force to flee out of the Nation ſo great a Part of the Kings Subjects as the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are, would be a diminiſhing of the People, and ſo a diminution of the Kings Honour and Safety.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's a Calumny raiſed by the adverſaries of the Nonconformiſts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Magiſtrates againſt them; that they ſhall not be eſteemed the Kings Friends if they do not ſuppreſs them. For our Soveraign Lord the King hath been graciouſly pleaſed in ſeveral of his Declarations, to teſtify unto his Kingdom, that he hath a kindneſs for his Nonconforming Subjects as well as the reſt of his Subjects. And beſides theſe, there may be other demonſtrations given that theſe Magiſtrates are true and real Friends to the King, who do ſhelter the Nonconformiſts from the fury of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and keep them from being perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake. As, 1. They are the Kings true and real Friends that uphold his throne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh his Throne for ever; and this they do that deliver the oppreſſed, and ſhew mercy to ſuch as are under affliction. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.14. <hi>The King that faithfully judgeth the Poor, his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever. Prov.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Mercy and truth preſerve the King, and his Throne is upholden by Mercy</hi> Who ſheweth mercy he that Puniſheth Men for Praying, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or he that Spareth them? 2. They are the Kings Friends that bring down the bleſſing of God upon the Kingdom, and cauſe him to wax great, and to be ſo feared by the Neighbour Nations that they make no War with him. And this they do who encourage the faithful Preachers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of God. When the Preaching of the Word of God was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> days; there were ſuch eminent Bleſſings came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and his Kingdom, that he waxed great exceedingly, and was feared of all the Lands round about, and none of them durſt make War with him. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>And with them he ſent Levites and Prieſts, and they taught in Judah, and had the book of the Law of the Lord with them, and went about through all the Cities of Judah, and taught the people, and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the Kindoms of the Lands, that were round about Judah; ſo that they made no War againſt Jehoſhaphat. And alſo ſome of the Philiſtins brought Jehoſhaphat Preſents, and Tribute Silver. The Arabians brought him Flocks. And Jehoſhaphat waxed great exceedingly.</hi>
